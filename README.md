# Differentiable Convex Modeling for Robotic Planning and Control

+ This repository is by [Kevin Tracy](http://kevintracy.info)
  and contains the full source code and data to produce
  [my thesis document](https://kevintracy.info/thesis.pdf).
+ This repository is based on [Brandon Amos' thesis repo](https://github.com/bamos/thesis).

Since this docuement is so large, you should really compile this locally using the make file. Do this by simply navigating to the root directory and doing `make` a few times. You can also run `make clean` to clean up any aux files before running `make` a few times. 

You can also hook this up with overleaf, but make sure not to ask overleaf to compile the full thing at once. When I did this, I commented out every section except the one I was currently working on (like here https://github.com/kevin-tracy/thesis/blob/main/thesis.tex#L102).
