  abstract = {We consider a comparison of active set vs. interior point strategies for the solution of receding time horizon problems in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). For this study we consider a control algorithm where we form quadratic programs (QPs) in each time horizon by linearizing the model. We also ignore second order information on the model and constraints. This approach can be viewed as a direct nonlinear extension of MPC with linear models and is easily tailored to include stabilizing constraints. Using this framework we consider the application of three active set strategies as well as interior point methods applied to both the NMPC and the QP subproblem. The first two active set methods (QPOPT and and QKWIK) are general purpose solvers that have been incorporated into SQP algorithms previously, while the third is a Schur complement approach that can easily exploit the sparse structure of the KKT matrix in MPC.},

  abstract = {A carrier phase reconstruction technique is presented as an enabler for low-power centimeter-accurate mobile positioning. Reliable carrier phase reconstruction permits the duty cycling of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver whose outputs are used for precise carrier-phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) positioning. Existing CDGNSS techniques are power intensive because they require continuous tracking of each GNSS signal's carrier phase. By contrast, the less-precise code-ranging technique that is commonly used in mobile devices for 3-to-10-meter-accurate positioning allows for aggressive measurement duty-cycling, which enables low-power implementations. The technique proposed in this paper relaxes the CDGNSS continuous phase tracking requirement by solving a mixed real and integer estimation problem to reconstruct a continuous carrier phase time history from intermittent phase measurement intervals each having an ambiguous initial phase. Theoretical bounds on the probability of successful phase reconstruction, corroborated by Monte-Carlo-type simulation, are used to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed technique to various system parameters, including the time period between successive phase measurement intervals, the duration of each interval, the carrier-to-noise ratio, and the line-of-sight acceleration uncertainty. A demonstration on real data indicates that coupling a GNSS receiver with a consumer-grade inertial measurement unit enables reliable phase reconstruction with phase measurement duty cycles as low as 5\%.},

The stability of the controller is investigated through Lyapunov function analysis and the local observability of the estimator is verified. The resulted attitude determination and control system has shown the capability of estimating the attitude better than 5deg and rate of order 0.03deg/s in addition to maintain the pointing accuracy within 5deg in each axis with pointing stability of less than 0.05deg/s. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the global asymptotic stability of the controller and the estimator for various initial conditions.},

We first motivate the use of representing nonlinear systems as linear Koopman operator systems by illustrating the improved model-based control performance with an actuated Van der Pol system. Information-theoretic methods are then applied to the Koopman operator formulation of dynamical systems where we derive a controller for active learning of robot dynamics. The active learning controller is shown to increase the rate of information about the Koopman operator. In addition, our active learning controller can readily incorporate policies built on the Koopman dynamics, enabling the benefits of fast active learning and improved control. Results using a quadcopter illustrate single-execution active learning and stabilization capabilities during free-fall. The results for active learning are extended for automating Koopman observables and we implement our method on real robotic systems.},

The soft landing problem with all relevant constraints can be posed as a finite-horizon optimal control problem with state and control constraints. The real-time generation of fuel-optimal paths to a prescribed location on a planet's surface is a challenging problem due to the constraints on the fuel, the control inputs, and the states.

A relatively underappreciated fact, due to Gander, Golub and von Matt in 1989, is that trust-region subproblems can be solved by one generalized eigenvalue problem, with no outer iterations. In this paper we rediscover this fact and discover its great practicality, which exhibits good performance both in accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we generalize the approach in various directions, namely by allowing for an ellipsoidal constraint, dealing with the so-called hard case, and obtaining approximate solutions efficiently when high accuracy is unnecessary. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is a general-purpose TRS solver, effective both for dense and large-sparse problems. Our algorithm is easy to implement: its essence is a few lines of MATLAB code.},

We compare results to more conventionally accepted methods of modeling wheel locomotion. While RFT is an empirical force model for arbitrarily-shaped bodies moving through granular media, MPM-based continuum modeling allows the simulation of full granular flow and stress fields. RFT allows for rapid evaluation of interaction forces on arbitrary shaped intruders based on a local surface stress formulation depending on depth, orientation, and movement of surface elements. We perform forced-slip experiments for three different wheel types and three different granular materials, and results are compared with RFT, continuum modeling, and a traditional terramechanics semi-empirical method. Results show that for the range of inputs considered, RFT can be reliably used to predict rigid wheel granular media interactions with accuracy exceeding that of traditional terramechanics methodology in several circumstances. Results also indicate that plasticity-based continuum modeling provides an accurate tool for wheel-soil interaction while providing more information to study the physical processes giving rise to resistive stresses in granular media.},

  abstract = {Animals are capable of precise and agile locomotion using vision. Replicating this ability has been a long-standing goal in robotics. The traditional approach has been to decompose this problem into elevation mapping and foothold planning phases. The elevation mapping, however, is susceptible to failure and large noise artifacts, requires specialized hardware, and is biologically implausible. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end locomotion system capable of traversing stairs, curbs, stepping stones, and gaps. We show this result on a medium-sized quadruped robot using a single front-facing depth camera. The small size of the robot necessitates discovering specialized gait patterns not seen elsewhere. The egocentric camera requires the policy to remember past information to estimate the terrain under its hind feet. We train our policy in simulation. Training has two phases - first, we train a policy using reinforcement learning with a cheap-to-compute variant of depth image and then in phase 2 distill it into the final policy that uses depth using supervised learning. The resulting policy transfers to the real world and is able to run in real-time on the limited compute of the robot. It can traverse a large variety of terrain while being robust to perturbations like pushes, slippery surfaces, and rocky terrain. Videos are at https://vision-locomotion.github.io},

  abstract = {Motion planning in belief space (under motion and sensing uncertainty) is a challenging problem due to the computational intractability of its exact solution. The Feedback-based Information RoadMap (FIRM) framework made an important theoretical step toward enabling roadmap-based planning in belief space and provided a computationally tractable version of belief space planning. However, there are still challenges in applying belief space planners to physical systems, such as the discrepancy between computational models and real physical models. In this paper, we propose a dynamic replanning scheme in belief space to address such challenges. Moreover, we present techniques to cope with changes in the environment (e.g., changes in the obstacle map), as well as unforeseen large deviations in the robot's location (e.g., the kidnapped robot problem). We then utilize these techniques to implement the first online replanning scheme in belief space on a physical mobile robot that is robust to changes in the environment and large disturbances. This method demonstrates that belief space planning is a practical tool for robot motion planning.},

We do this by implicitly differentiating the residual map for its homogeneous self-dual embedding, and solving the linear systems of equations required using an iterative method. This allows us to efficiently compute the derivative operator, and its adjoint, evaluated at a vector. These correspond to computing an approximate new solution, given a perturbation to the cone program coefficients (i.e., perturbation analysis), and to computing the gradient of a function of the solution with respect to the coefficients. Our method scales to large problems, with numbers of coefficients in the millions. We present an open-source Python implementation of our method that solves a cone program and returns the derivative and its adjoint as abstract linear maps; our implementation can be easily integrated into software systems for automatic differentiation.},

This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver's solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.},

  abstract = {Discovery of fundamental principles which govern and limit effective locomotion (selfpropulsion) is of intellectual interest and practical importance. Human technology has created robotic moving systems that excel in movement on and within environments of societal interest: paved roads, open air and water. However, such devices cannot yet robustly and efficiently navigate (as animals do) the enormous diversity of natural environments which might be of future interest for autonomous robots; examples include vertical surfaces like trees and cliffs, heterogeneous ground like desert rubble and brush, turbulent flows found near seashores, and deformable/flowable substrates like sand, mud and soil. In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems---a `locomotion robophysics'---which we define as the pursuit of principles of self-generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important intellectual complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of researchers from engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that we must complement the study of complex robots in complex situations with systematic study of simplified robotic devices in controlled laboratory settings and in simplified theoretical models. We must thus use the methods of physics to examine both locomotor successes and failures using parameter space exploration, systematic control, and techniques from dynamical systems. Using examples from our and others' research, we will discuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the creation of devices that have begun to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and within complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low dimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and have been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex terrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing robot models with easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists and engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment, theory and computation.},

The reliance of this technique on large-scale semidefinite programs however, has limited the scale of problems to which it can be applied. In this paper, we introduce DSOS and SDSOS optimization as linear programming and second-order cone programming-based alternatives to sum of squares optimization that allow one to trade off computation time with solution quality. These are optimization problems over certain subsets of sum of squares polynomials (or equivalently subsets of positive semidefinite matrices), which can be of interest in general applications of semidefinite programming where scalability is a limitation. We show that some basic theorems from SOS optimization which rely on results from real algebraic geometry are still valid for DSOS and SDSOS optimization. Furthermore, we show with numerical experiments from diverse application areas---polynomial optimization, statistics and machine learning, derivative pricing, and control theory---that with reasonable tradeoffs in accuracy, we can handle problems at scales that are currently significantly beyond the reach of traditional sum of squares approaches. Finally, we provide a review of recent techniques that bridge the gap between our DSOS/SDSOS approach and the SOS approach at the expense of additional running time. The Supplementary Material of the paper introduces an accompanying MATLAB package for DSOS and SDSOS optimization.},

Therefore, utilizing reaction wheels for satellite detumbling at higher initial velocities is vital but they are heavy and occupy significant space on a spacecraft having challenging control. To address this challenge, this paper features a disruptive approach that conducts the control only by the PCB-integrated magnetorquers with various geometries using a diverse non-unity track width ratio. The trace widths are parametrized such that the optimal torque to power dissipation ratio is investigated. The optimizations are then simulated for various geometric distributions and validated through comprehensive measurement setups that establish a framework for selecting the best-case coil configuration according to mission requirements. The detumbling rates of multiple asymmetric coil configurations are compared with the embedded designs in published literature and state of the art. It is found that the proposed asymmetric embedded magnetorquers can detumble the vehicle at high initial angular velocities. Lastly, the simulation results of thermal analysis are validated for selecting the application-specific optimal coils configuration. At the end, the proposed system is compared with the embedded magnetorquers available in the literature and commercial attitude control systems.},

Broadly, there are two approaches for controlling uncertain systems: design robust controllers in spite of uncertainty, or characterize a system before attempting to control it. This paper proposes a middle-ground approach, making trajectory progress while also accounting for gaining information about the system. More specifically, it combines excitation trajectories which are usually intended to optimize information gain for an estimator, with goal-driven trajectory optimization metrics. For this purpose, a measure of information gain is incorporated (using the Fisher Information Matrix) in a real-time planning framework to produce trajectories favorable for estimation. At the same time, the planner receives stable parameter updates from the estimator, enhancing the system model. An implementation of this learn-as-you-go approach utilizing an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) is demonstrated in simulation. Results for cases with and without information gain and online parameter updates in the system model are presented.},

  abstract = {Background: Deficits in motor control can be observed with a decrease in plantar sensation. There is evidence that changing the plantar feedback leads to kinematic, kinetic and neuromuscular adaptations in static as well as dynamic conditions. The effect of changes in plantar feedback on the modulation of gait has not been clarified conclusively. Objectives: The purpose of this paper was to provide a review of studies reporting the effects of changes in plantar feedback on human gait characteristics. Method: The databases Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) were searched for clinical (CTs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning foot sensation and gait. Results: Twenty-three studies were included in the evaluation. Several methods were used to affect the sensitivity of the foot sole. After cooling or sedating the foot sole, predominant changes occur in decreased peak pressures, muscle activities and joint angles, and relocation of the centre of pressure under the foot was found. Walking on uneven surfaces results in a decrease in gait velocity, cadence and step length and also an increase in step variability. The use of textured insoles during walking leads to increased knee, hip and ankle angles, forces and moments in neurological patients with decreased foot sensation. In particular, individuals with sensory deficits show significant gait improvements when using textured or vibrating insoles. Conclusions: Changes in plantar feedback lead to stimulation-specific adaptations of gait characteristics. Further prospective RCTs should be performed to investigate interventions for enhancing plantar receptor feedback for the prevention of falls and the treatment of injuries and movement disorders.},

This provides one way of leveraging and combining the advantages of model-free and model-based approaches. Specifically, we differentiate through MPC by using the KKT conditions of the convex approximation at a fixed point of the controller. Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class. We show that our MPC policies are significantly more data-efficient than a generic neural network and that our method is superior to traditional system identification in a setting where the expert is unrealizable.},

In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems. In one notable example, we show that the method is capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard constraints better than other neural architectures.},

  abstract = {This article surveys the System Level Synthesis framework, which presents a novel perspective on constrained robust and optimal controller synthesis for linear systems. We show how SLS shifts the controller synthesis task from the design of a controller to the design of the entire closed loop system, and highlight the benefits of this approach in terms of scalability and transparency. We emphasize two particular applications SLS, namely large-scale distributed optimal control and robust control. In the case of distributed control, we show how SLS allows for localized controllers to be computed, extending robust and optimal control methods to large-scale systems under practical and realistic assumptions. In the case of robust control, we show how SLS allows for novel design methodologies that allow, for the first time, for the degradation in performance of a robust controller due to model uncertainty to be quantified in terms of the size of the uncertainty itself -- such transparency is key in allowing robust control methods to interact, in a principled way, with modern techniques from machine learning and statistical inference. Throughout, we emphasize practical and efficient computational solutions, and illustrate our methods on several case studies.},

  author = {Aoude, Georges Salim},
  publisher = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
  abstract = {The thesis presents a two-stage approach for designing optimal reconfiguration maneuvers for multiple spacecraft. These maneuvers involve well-coordinated and highlycoupled motions of the entire fleet of spacecraft while satisfying an arbitrary number of constraints. This problem is particularly difficult because of the nonlinearity of the attitude dynamics, the non-convexity of some of the constraints, and the coupling between the positions and attitudes of all spacecraft. As a result, the trajectory design must be solved as a single 6N \{DOF\} problem instead of N separate 6 \{DOF\} problems. The first stage of the solution approach quickly provides a feasible initial solution by solving a simplified version without differential constraints using a bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (\{RRT\}) planner. A transition algorithm then augments this guess with feasible dynamics that are propagated from the beginning to the end of the trajectory. The resulting output is a feasible initial guess to the complete optimal control problem that is discretized in the second stage using a Gauss pseudospectral method (\{GPM\}) and solved using an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. This thesis also places emphasis on the importance of the initialization step in pseudospectral methods in order to decrease their computation times. It demonstrates the improvement that an initial guess based on an \{RRT\} planner brings to an optimal control problem solved using pseudospectral methods. Finally, this thesis presents the successful results of several reconfiguration maneuver experiments performed using the Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (\{SPHERES\}) hardware testbed onboard the International Space Station (\{ISS\}). The maneuvers were designed using two different two-stage algorithms presented in this work. It also discusses the lessons learnt from these tests, and the recommendations to improve future \{ISS\} reconfiguration experiments.},

This property does not depend on the type of perturbation, on the integrator used, or on the initial conditions, including the nominal eccentricity. The error growth of the physical time evolution and the Kepler energy is proportional to s if the perturbed harmonic oscillator part of the equation of motion is integrated by a time-symmetric integration formula, such as the leapfrog or the symmetric multistep method, and is proportional to s2 when using traditional integrators, such as the Runge-Kutta, Adams, Sto rmer, and extrapolation methods. Also, we discovered that the K-S regularization avoids the step size resonance/instability of the symmetric multistep method that appears in the unregularized cases. Therefore, the K-S regularized equation of motion is useful to investigate the long-term behavior of perturbed two-body problems, namely, those used for studying the dynamics of comets, minor planets, the Moon, and other natural and arti{\DH}cial satellites.},

We detail the updating rules for monitoring the different parameters (Lagrange multiplier estimate, quadratic penalty and log-barrier parameter), in order to get strong global convergence properties. We show that one advantage of this approach is that it introduces a natural regularization of the linear system to solve at each iteration, for the solution of a problem with a rank deficient Jacobian of constraints. The numerical experiments show the good practical performances of the proposed method especially for degenerate problems.},

  abstract = {Cloth manipulation is common in both housework and manufacturing. However, robotic cloth manipulation remains challenging, especially for less controlled and open-goal settings. We consider the problem of open-goal planning for robotic cloth manipulation, with focus on the roles of cloth representation and epistemic uncertainty. Core of our system is a neural network trained as a forward model of cloth behaviour under manipulation, with planning performed through backpropagation. We introduce a neural network-based routine for estimating mesh representations from voxel input, and perform planning in mesh format internally. We address the problem of planning with incomplete domain knowledge by introducing an explicit epistemic uncertainty penalty, using prediction divergence between two instances of the forward model network as a proxy of epistemic uncertainty. This allows us to avoid plans with high epistemic uncertainty during planning. Finally, we introduce logic for handling restriction of grasp points to a discrete set of candidates, in order to accommodate graspability constraints imposed by robotic hardware. We evaluate the system's mesh estimation, prediction, and planning ability on simulated cloth for sequences of one to three manipulations. Comparative experiments confirm that planning on basis of estimated meshes improves accuracy compared to voxel-based planning, and that epistemic uncertainty avoidance improves performance under conditions of incomplete domain knowledge. Planning time cost is a few seconds. We additionally present qualitative results on robot hardware. Our results indicate that representation format and epistemic uncertainty are important factors to consider for open-goal cloth manipulation planning.},

The regularization is equivalent to applying an augmented Lagrangian method but the linear system used to compute a search direction is reminiscent of regularized sequential quadratic programming. A limited-memory BFGS approximation to second derivatives allows us to employ iterative methods for linear least squares to compute steps, resulting in a factorization-free implementation. We establish global and fast local convergence under weak assumptions. In particular, we do not require the LICQ and our method is suitable for degenerate problems. Preliminary numerical experiments show that a factorization-based implementation of our method exhibits significant robustness while a factorization-free implementation, though not as robust, is promising. We briefly discuss generalizing our framework to other classes of methods and to problems with inequality constraints.},

  abstract = {Location of pedestrian in indoor environment remains an open problem. A cheap and reliable sensor in this context is the inertial measurement units (IMU), carried by the pedestrian while he/she is walking. However, due to the bias of both the accelerometer and the gyroscope, integrating directly the inertial measurements leads to tremendous drift, as the state of the system (position, orientation, velocity, bias) is not fully observable. In this paper, we consider the specific case where an IMU is attached to one of the pedestrian's feet. We exploit specific prior knowledges (i.e. the fact that the foot lands at zero velocity on a horizontal plane) in order to make the full state of the IMU observable. The inertial measurements and these prior knowledges are gathered in a graphical model (a factor graph), and are exploited to build a maximum-likelihood estimator. The technical difficulty is to handle the size of the graph such that it is tractable in a limited time window, that we do by relying on the pre-integration technique. In that existing framework, our contributions are to reformulate the pre-integration method using quaternions while giving a simpler algebraic formulation, and to apply this method for estimating the human foot-pose during walking. We validate these concepts on several long-range trajectories capture with human subject and compare the results with ground-truth measurements (coming from a motion capture system) and previous results of the state of the art.},

Such controllers often rely heavily upon heuristics or, due to the combinatoric structure in the dynamics, are unsuitable for real-time control. Principled deployment of tactile sensors offers a promising mechanism for stable and robust control, but modern approaches often use this data in an ad hoc manner, for instance to guide guarded moves. In this work, by exploiting the complementarity structure of contact dynamics, we propose a control framework which can close the loop on rich, tactile sensors. Critically, this framework is non-combinatoric, enabling optimization algorithms to automatically synthesize provably stable control policies. We demonstrate this approach on three different underactuated, multi-contact robotics problems.},

Motivated by an observation that the hidden layers of many existing deep sequence models converge towards some fixed point, we propose the DEQ approach that directly finds these equilibrium points via root-finding. Such a method is equivalent to running an infinite depth (weight-tied) feedforward network, but has the notable advantage that we can analytically backpropagate through the equilibrium point using implicit differentiation. Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only constant memory, regardless of the effective "depth" of the network. We demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. On large-scale language modeling tasks, such as the WikiText-103 benchmark, we show that DEQs 1) often improve performance over these state-of-the-art models (for similar parameter counts); 2) have similar computational requirements to existing models; and 3) vastly reduce memory consumption (often the bottleneck for training large sequence models), demonstrating an up-to 88\% memory reduction in our experiments.

The Lyapunov function constitutes a part of the controller algorithm. By combining this with existing stability theory for switched systems, the stability analysis of the overall system follows directly. The framework assumes that a Lyapunov function is given, and that full state measurement is available for feedback. Moreover, an estimator is needed to give a coarse estimate of the system equilibrium point.},

Specifically, leveraging a dataset of expert trajectories from GuSTO, we devise a neural-network-based approach to predict a locally optimal state and control trajectory, which is used to warmstart the SCP algorithm. This approach allows one to retain all the theoretical guarantees of GuSTO while simultaneously taking advantage of the fast execution of the neural network and reducing the time and number of iterations required for GuSTO to converge. The result is a faster and theoretically guaranteed trajectory optimization algorithm.},

The generated C code is library-free and has a very small compiled footprint. Examples arising in real-world applications show that the generated code outperforms state-of-the-art embedded and desktop QP solvers.},

  abstract = {Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is an important formal verification method for guaranteeing performance and safety properties of dynamical systems; it has been applied to many small-scale systems in the past decade. Its advantages include compatibility with general nonlinear system dynamics, formal treatment of bounded disturbances, and the availability of well-developed numerical tools. The main challenge is addressing its exponential computational complexity with respect to the number of state variables. In this tutorial, we present an overview of basic HJ reachability theory and provide instructions for using the most recent numerical tools, including an efficient GPU-parallelized implementation of a Level Set Toolbox for computing reachable sets. In addition, we review some of the current work in high-dimensional HJ reachability to show how the dimensionality challenge can be alleviated via various general theoretical and applicationspecific insights.},

  abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This paper describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulation method based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier methods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameterizing a system's degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the system's dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the constraints' topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate approaches, nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). This makes it practical to simulate complicated, closedloop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is provided in pseudocode.},

This paper describes a cloth simulation system that can stably take large time steps. The simulation system couples a new technique for enforcing constraints on individual cloth particles with an implicit integration method. The simulator models cloth as a triangular mesh, with internal cloth forces derived using a simple continuum formulation that supports modeling operations such as local anisotropic stretch or compression; a unified treatment of damping forces is included as well. The implicit integration method generates a large, unbanded sparse linear system at each time step which is solved using a modified conjugate gradient method that simultaneously enforces particles' constraints. The constraints are always maintained exactly, independent of the number of conjugate gradient iterations, which is typically small. The resulting simulation system is significantly faster than previous accounts of cloth simulation systems in the literature.},

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply ``autodiff'', is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names ``dynamic computational graphs'' and ``differentiable programming''. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms ``autodiff'', ``automatic differentiation'', and ``symbolic differentiation'' as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

By comparing pulse arrival times measured on-board a spacecraft with predicted pulse arrivals at a reference location, the spacecraft position can be determined autonomously and with high accuracy everywhere in the solar system and beyond. The unique properties of pulsars make clear already today that such a navigation system will have its application in future astronautics.

These individual features offer a level of synergistic motion control not previously seen in other starfish-inspired robots. For example, our bistable dome-like tube feet are capable of achieving high adhesion forces to ferrous surfaces and low removal forces. These tube feet are further integrated with a fluidic engine to drive the entire arm while maintaining the ability to accurately control the arm position with a 270{$^\circ$} range of motion. Furthermore, the arm and fluidic engine are modular, allowing each of the five arms to be replaced in seconds or enabling the exploration of a variety of limb geometries. Through the incorporation of these different design elements, the ASTER-bot (named for its star-like body plan) is capable of locomotion on ferrous surfaces, above and below water, and on nonplanar surfaces. This article further describes the design, fabrication, and integration strategies and characterizes the energetic and locomotory performance of this pentaradial robotic prototype.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to trajectory optimization for autonomous fixed-wing aerial vehicles performing large-scale maneuvers. The main result is a planner which designs nearly minimum time planar trajectories to a goal, constrained by no-fly zones and the vehicle's maximum speed and turning rate. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is used for the optimization, and is well suited to trajectory optimization because it can incorporate logical constraints, such as no-fly zone avoidance, and continuous constraints, such as aircraft dynamics. MILP is applied over a receding planning horizon to reduce the computational effort of the planner and to incorporate feedback. In this approach, MILP is used to plan short trajectories that extend towards the goal, but do not necessarily reach it. The cost function accounts for decisions beyond the planning horizon by estimating the time to reach the goal from the plan's end point. This time is estimated by searching a graph representation of the environment. This approach is shown to avoid entrapment behind obstacles, to yield near-optimal performance when comparison with the minimum arrival time found using a fixed horizon controller is possible, and to work consistently on large trajectory optimization problems that are intractable for the fixed horizon controller.},

Our novel approach can handle arbitrary triangle meshes and is not restricted to regular grid meshes which are required by other adaptive methods. Most previous works in the area of adaptive cloth simulation use discrete cloth models like mass-spring systems in combination with a specific subdivision scheme. However, if discrete models are used, the simulation does not converge to the correct solution as the mesh is refined. Therefore, we introduce a cloth model which is based on continuum mechanics since continuous models do not have this problem. We use a linear elasticity model in combination with a corotational formulation to achieve a high performance. Furthermore, we present an efficient method to update the sparse matrix structure after{\textsurd}a refinement or coarsening step.},

Our method enables fast solutions to sequential decision making under uncertainty for a variety of problems involving noisy or incomplete observations and stochastic actions. We present an efficient approach to compute locally-valid approximations to the value function over continuous spaces in time polynomial (O[n{\textasciicircum}4]) in the dimension n of the state space. To directly tackle the intractability of solving general POMDPs, we leverage the assumption that beliefs are Gaussian distributions over the state space, approximate the belief update using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and represent the value function by a function that is quadratic in the mean and linear in the variance of the belief. Our approach iterates towards a linear control policy over the state space that is locally-optimal with respect to a user defined cost function, and is approximately valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. We demonstrate the scalability and potential of our approach on problems inspired by robot navigation under uncertainty for state spaces of up to 128 dimensions.},

In the backward pass the cost-to-go function is computed using the standard LQR Riccati equation that runs backward in time, and in the forward pass the cost-to-come function is computed using a Riccati equation that runs forward in time. The sum of the cost-to-go and the cost-to-come function gives the total-cost function, and we will show that the states for which the total-cost function is minimal constitute the minimum-cost trajectory for the linear-quadratic optimal control problem. This insight is used to construct a fast-converging iterative procedure to compute a locally-optimal feedback control policy for systems with non-linear dynamics and non-quadratic cost, where in each iteration the current minimal-total-cost states provide natural points about which the dynamics can be linearized and the cost quadratized. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on two illustrative non-linear control problems involving physical differential-drive robots and simulated quadrotor helicopters in environments with obstacles, and show that our approach converges in only about a third of the number of iterations required by existing approaches such as Iterative LQR.},

Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigid-bodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dynamic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the coupling between bending and twisting modes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.},

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

They are therefore exciting for applications like search and rescue or medicine, which involve a high degree of uncertainty, and require interacting with humans. However, the best way to model and control soft robots largely remains an open question. One promising approach is to leverage physically-based modeling techniques such as the finite element method. However, such techniques are inherently limited by their physical assumptions. Indeed, real-world soft robots are often made from unpredictable materials, using imprecise techniques. Data-driven approaches provide an exciting alternative, as they can learn real-world fabrication defects and asymmetries. In this paper we present our first investigation into using machine learning to do soft robot control. We learn a differentiable model of a soft robot's quasi-static physics, and then perform gradient-based optimization to find optimal open-loop control inputs. We find that our learned model captures phenomena that would be absent from an idealized physically-based simulation. We also present practical techniques for acquiring high-quality motion capture data, and observations the effect of network complexity on model accuracy.},

  abstract = {In the present work, rigid bodies and multibody systems are regarded as constrained mechanical systems at the outset. The constraints may be divided into two classes: (i) internal constraints which are intimately connected with the assumption of rigidity of the bodies, and (ii) external constraints related to the presence of joints in a multibody framework. Concerning external constraints lower kinematic pairs such as revolute and prismatic pairs are treated in detail. Both internal and external constraints are dealt with on an equal footing. The present approach thus circumvents the use of rotational variables throughout the whole time discretization. After the discretization has been completed a size-reduction of the discrete system is performed by eliminating the constraint forces. In the wake of the size-reduction potential conditioning problems are eliminated. The newly proposed methodology facilitates the design of energy--momentum methods for multibody dynamics. The numerical examples deal with a gyro top, cylindrical and planar pairs and a six-body linkage. Copyright ᭧ 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The control problem is thus transcribed into a large scale constrained optimization problem with a finite number of variables. It is necessary to solve the nonlinear programming (NLP) problem produced by the discretization as efficiently as possible, and research has focused on methods for solving the underlying NLP when the relevant Jacobian and Hessian matrices are sparse. However little attention has been given to computing the Jacobian and Hessian, particularly for applications that require finite difference techniques. Typically it is assumed that these matrices have a block structure, and when standard finite difference estimates are used this operation is a major computational expense. This paper describes how to actually construct the Jacobian and Hessian matrices efficiently, and exploit sparsity inherent in the problem. This new technique can significantly reduce the computational costs when the original optimal control problem has many state and control variables.},

This approach combines a sparse nonlinear programming algorithm with a discretization of the trajectory dynamics.

Low thrust trajectories are demanding because realistic forces, due to oblateness, and third-body perturbations often dominate the thrust. Furthermore, because the thrust is so low, significant changes to the orbits require very long duration trajectories. When a collocation method is applied to a problem of this type, the resulting nonlinear program is very large, because the trajectories are long, and very nonlinear because of the perturbing forces.},

First, sufficient conditions for accessibility, strong accessibility and controllability of a general time-varying system are presented. These conditions involve application of Lie-algebraic rank conditions to the autonomous extended system obtained by augmenting the state of the original time-varying system by the time variable, and require the rank conditions to be checked only on the complement of a finite union of level sets of a finite number of smooth functions. At each point of each level set, it is sufficient to verify escape conditions involving Lie derivatives of the functions defining the level sets along linear combinations over smooth functions of vector fields in the accessibility algebra. These sufficient conditions are used to show that the attitude dynamics of a spacecraft actuated by three magnetic actuators and subjected to a general time-varying magnetic field are strongly accessible if the magnetic field and its time derivative are linearly independent at every instant. In addition, if the magnetic field is periodic in time, then the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft are controllable. These results are used to show that the attitude dynamics of a spacecraft actuated by three magnetic actuators in a closed Keplerian orbit in a nonrotating dipole approximation of the geomagnetic field are strongly accessible and controllable if the orbital plane does not coincide with the geomagnetic equatorial plane.},

This online joint velocity and ground reaction force optimization integrates a kinodynamic model of a wheeled quadrupedal robot. It defines the single rigid body dynamics along with the robot's kinematics while treating the wheels as moving ground contacts. With this approach, we can accurately capture the robot's rolling constraint and dynamics, enabling automatic discovery of hybrid maneuvers without needless motion heuristics. The formulation's generality through the simultaneous optimization over the robot's whole-body variables allows for a single set of parameters and makes online gait sequence adaptation possible. Aperiodic gait sequences are automatically found through kinematic leg utilities without the need for predefined contact and lift-off timings, reducing the cost of transport by up to 85 \%. Our experiments demonstrate dynamic motions on a quadrupedal robot with non-steerable wheels in challenging indoor and outdoor environments. The paper's findings contribute to evaluating a decomposed, i.e., sequential optimization of wheel and torso motion, and single-task motion planner with a novel quantity, the prediction error, which describes how well a receding horizon planner can predict the robot's future state. To this end, we report an improvement of up to 71 \% using our proposed single-task approach, making fast locomotion feasible and revealing wheeled-legged robots' full potential.}

  abstract = {To increase the science return of future missions to Mars and to enable sample return missions, the accuracy with which a lander can be delivered to the Martian surface must be improved by orders of magnitude. The prior work developed a convex-optimization-based minimum-fuel powered-descent guidance algorithm. In this paper, this convex-optimization-based approach is extended to handle the case when no feasible trajectory to the target exists. In this case, the objective is to generate the minimum-landing-error trajectory, which is the trajectory that minimizes the distance to the prescribed target while using the available fuel optimally. This problem is inherently a nonconvex optimal control problem due to a nonzero lower bound on the magnitude of the feasible thrust vector. It is first proven that an optimal solution of a convex relaxation of the problem is also optimal for the original nonconvex problem, which is referred to as a lossless convexification of the original nonconvex problem. Then it is shown that the minimum-landing-error trajectory generation problem can be posed as a convex optimization problem and solved to global optimality with known bounds on convergence time. This makes the approach amenable to onboard implementation for real-time applications. Nomenclature c = vector component of cone constraint D = constraint on distance-to-target in horizontal plane},

We propose a convex relaxation of the nonconvex control constraints, and prove that the optimal solution to the relaxed problem is the globally optimal solution to the original problem with nonconvex control constraints. This lossless convexification enables a computationally simpler problem to be solved instead of the original problem. We demonstrate the approach in simulation with a planetary soft landing problem involving a nonlinear gravity field.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new robust, dynamic quadruped, the MIT Cheetah 3. Like its predecessor, the Cheetah 3 exploits tailored mechanical design to enable simple control strategies for dynamic locomotion and features highbandwidth proprioceptive actuators to manage physical interaction with the environment. A new leg design is presented that includes proprioceptive actuation on the abduction/adduction degrees of freedom in addition to an expanded range of motion on the hips and knees. To make full use of these new capabilities, general balance and locomotion controllers for Cheetah 3 are presented. These controllers are embedded into a modular control architecture that allows the robot to handle unexpected terrain disturbances through reactive gait modification and without the need for external sensors or prior environment knowledge. The efficiency of the robot is demonstrated by a low Cost of Transport (CoT) over multiple gaits at moderate speeds, with the lowest CoT of 0.45 found during trotting. Experiments showcase the ability to blindly climb up stairs as a result of the full system integration. These results collectively represent a promising step toward a platform capable of generalized dynamic legged locomotion.},

  abstract = {As legged robots are sent into unstructured environments, the ability to robustly manage contact transitions will be a critical skill. This paper introduces an approach to probabilistically fuse contact models, managing uncertainty in terrain geometry, dynamic modeling, and kinematics to improve the robustness of contact initiation at touchdown. A discrete-time extension of the generalized-momentum disturbance observer is presented to increase the accuracy of proprioceptive force control estimates. This information is fused with other contact priors under a framework of Kalman Filtering to increase robustness of the method. This approach results in accurate contact detection with 99.3\% accuracy and a small 4 - 5ms delay. Using this new detector, an Event-Based Finite State Machine is implemented to deal with unexpected early and late contacts. This allows the robot to traverse cluttered environments by modifying the control actions for each individual leg based on the estimated contact state rather than adhering to a rigid time schedule regardless of actual contact state. Experiments with the MIT Cheetah 3 robot show the success of both the detection algorithm, as well as the EventBased FSM while making unexpected contacts during trotting.},

Often in academic literature not enough attention is given to the implementation details that make the theory work in practice and many times it is precisely these details that end up being critical to the success or failure of the theory in real world applications. Nonlinear optimization for real-time legged locomotion control in particular is one of the techniques that has shown promise, but falls short when implemented on hardware systems subjected to computation limits and undesirable local minima.

The key idea is to extract information from the kinematic constraints given through the intermittent contacts with the ground and to fuse this information with inertial measurements. To this end, we design an unscented Kalman filter based on a consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic model. To increase the robustness of the filter, an outliers rejection methodology is included into the update step. Furthermore, we present the nonlinear observability analysis of the system, where, by considering the special nature of 3D rotations, we obtain a relatively simple form of the corresponding observability matrix. This yields, that, except for the global position and the yaw angle, all states are in general observable. This also holds if only one foot is in contact with the ground. The presented filter is evaluated on a real quadruped robot trotting over an uneven and slippery terrain.},

  abstract = {High-speed aerospace engineering applications rely heavily on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models for design and analysis due to the expense and difficulty of flight tests and experiments. This reliance on CFD models necessitates performing accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the CFD models. However, it is very computationally expensive to run CFD for hypersonic flows due to the fine grid resolution required to capture the strong shocks and large gradients that are typically present. Furthermore, UQ approaches are ``many-query'' problems requiring many runs with a wide range of input parameters. One way to enable computationally expensive models to be used in such many-query problems is to employ projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) in lieu of the (high-fidelity) full-order model. In particular, the least-squares Petrov--Galerkin (LSPG) ROM (equipped with hyper-reduction) has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce simulation costs while retaining high levels of accuracy on a range of problems including subsonic CFD applications. This allows computationally inexpensive LSPG ROM simulations to replace the full-order model simulations in UQ studies, which makes this many-query task tractable, even for large-scale CFD models. This work presents the first application of LSPG to a hypersonic CFD application. In particular, we present results for LSPG ROMs of the HIFiRE-1 in a three-dimensional, turbulent Mach 7.1 flow, showcasing the ability of the ROM to significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining high levels of accuracy in computed quantities of interest},

In this paper, we present \{GuSTO\} (Guaranteed Sequential Trajectory Optimization), an algorithmic framework to solve trajectory optimization problems for control-affine systems with drift. \{GuSTO\} generalizes earlier \{SCP\}-based methods for trajectory optimization (by addressing, for example, goal region constraints and problems with either fixed or free final time), and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees in terms of convergence to, at least, a stationary point. The theoretical analysis is further leveraged to devise an accelerated implementation of \{GuSTO\}, which originally infuses ideas from indirect optimal control into an \{SCP\} context. Numerical experiments on a variety of trajectory optimization setups show that \{GuSTO\} generally outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of success rates, solution quality, and computation times.},

It is intrinsic in the sense that it does not rely on a specific choice of coordinates on \$SO(3)\$: the result is derived using rotation matrices, but remains valid when using other parameterizations, such as quaternions. For any estimator \${\textbackslash}hat R\$ of \$R{\textbackslash}in SO(3)\$ we give indeed a lower bound on the quantity \$E({\textbackslash}log(R{\textbackslash}hat R{\textasciicircum}T))\$, that is, the estimation error expressed in terms of group multiplication, whereas the usual estimation error \$E({\textbackslash}hat R-R)\$ is meaningless on \$SO(3)\$. The result is first applied to Whaba's problem. Then, we consider the problem of a continuous-time nonlinear deterministic system on \$SO(3)\$ with discrete measurements subject to additive isotropic Gaussian noise, and we derive a lower bound to the estimation error covariance matrix. We prove the intrinsic Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound coincides with the covariance matrix returned by the Invariant EKF, and thus can be computed online. This is in sharp contrast with the general case, where the bound can only be computed if the true trajectory of the system is known.},

  abstract = {According to all available findings at international level, the Kessler syndrome, increase of the number of space debris in Low Earth Orbits due to mutual collisions, appears now to be a fact, triggered mainly by several major break-ups in orbit which occurred since 2007. The time may have come to study how to clean this fundamentally useful orbital region in an active way. CNES has studied potential solutions for more than 12 years! The paper aims at reviewing the current status of these activities. The high level requirements are fundamental, and have to be properly justified. The working basis, as confirmed through IADC studies consists in the removal of 5--10 integer objects from the overcrowded orbits, spent upper stages or old satellites, as identified by NASA. The logic of CNES activities consider a stepped approach aiming at progressively gaining the required Technological Readiness Level on the features required for Active Debris Removal which have not yet been demonstrated in orbit. The rendezvous with a non-cooperative, un-prepared, tumbling debris is essential. Following maturation gained with Research and Technology programs, a set of small orbital demonstrators could enable a confidence high enough to perform a full end to end demonstration performing the de-orbiting of a large debris and paving the way for the development of a first generation operational de-orbiter. The internal CNES studies, led together by the Toulouse Space Centre and the Paris Launcher Directorate, have started in 2008 and led to a detailed System Requirements Document used for the Industrial studies. Three industrial teams did work under CNES contract during 2011, led by Thales Alenia Space, Bertin Technologies and Astrium Space Transportation, with numerous sub-contractors. Their approaches were very rich, complementary, and innovative. The second phase of studies began mid-2012. Some key questions nevertheless have to be resolved, and correspond generally to current IADC actions: The casualty risk associated to a ``passive'' de-orbitation is of paramount importance, major driver between passive and active re-entry, The residual movement of debris is crucial for the interfacing phase, whichever the solution is, The debris physical state in orbit is a major question, Some solutions increase the collision risk, but for a limited time period; we may not have yet the appropriate tools. The paper gives a status of where we stand, of the cooperation with the international partners, and raises the questions which remain open and have to be dealt with in the coming months.},

  abstract = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas-Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for {$\ell$}1 problems, proximal methods, and thers. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations. {\copyright} 2011 S.

Such work usually relies on special markers printed on the fabric to establish temporally coherent correspondences between points on the garment's surface at different times. Unfortunately, this approach is tedious and prevents the capture of off-the-shelf clothing made from interesting fabrics. In this paper, we describe a marker-free approach to capturing garment motion that avoids these downsides. We establish temporally coherent parameterizations between incomplete geometries that we extract at each timestep with a multiview stereo algorithm. We then fill holes in the geometry using a template. This approach, for the first time, allows us to capture the geometry and motion of unpatterned, off-the-shelf garments made from a range of different fabrics.},

Current plans for human exploration of Mars call for the landing of 40-80 t surface elements at scientifically interesting locations within close proximity (10's of m) of pre-positioned robotic assets. This paper summarizes past successful entry, descent and landing systems and approaches being developed by the robotic Mars exploration program to increased landed performance (mass, accuracy and surface elevation). In addition, the entry, descent and landing sequence for a human exploration system will be reviewed, highlighting the technology and systems advances required.},

Section 3 introduces the basic framework of differential games for two players. Open-loop solutions, where the controls implemented by the players depend only on time, are considered in Section 4. It is shown that Nash and Stackelberg solutions can be computed by solving a two-point boundary value problem for a system of ODEs, derived from the Pontryagin maximum principle.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems can be made easier to control by lifting them into the space of observable functions, where their evolution is described by the linear Koopman operator. This letter describes how the Koopman operator can be used to generate approximate linear, bilinear, and nonlinear model realizations from data, and argues in favor of bilinear realizations for characterizing systems with unknown dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a dynamical system to have a valid linear or bilinear realization over a given set of observable functions are presented and used to show that every control-affine system admits an infinite-dimensional bilinear realization, but does not necessarily admit a linear one. Therefore, approximate bilinear realizations constructed from generic sets of basis functions tend to improve as the number of basis functions increases, whereas approximate linear realizations may not. To demonstrate the advantages of bilinear Koopman realizations for control, a linear, bilinear, and nonlinear Koopman model realization of a simulated robot arm is constructed from data. In a trajectory following task, the bilinear realization exceeds the prediction accuracy of the linear realization and the computational efficiency of the nonlinear realization when incorporated into a model predictive control framework.},

Koopman operator theory offers a way to construct explicit dynamical models of soft robots and to control them using established model-based control methods. This approach is data driven, yet yields an explicit control-oriented model rather than just a ``black-box'' input-output mapping. This work describes a Koopman-based system identification method and its application to model predictive control (MPC) design for soft robots. Three MPC controllers are developed for a pneumatic soft robot arm via the Koopman-based approach, and their performances are evaluated with respect to several real-world trajectory following tasks. In terms of average tracking error, these Koopman-based controllers are more than three times more accurate than a benchmark MPC controller based on a linear state-space model of the same system, demonstrating the utility of the Koopman approach in controlling real soft robots.},

Recent research in pedestrian tracking has shown that motion can be inferred from inertial data using convolutional neural networks. A learned inertial displacement measurement can improve state estimation in challenging scenarios where leg odometry is unreliable, such as slipping and compressible terrains. Our work learns to estimate a displacement measurement from IMU data which is then fused with traditional leg odometry. Our approach greatly reduces the drift of proprioceptive state estimation, which is critical for legged robots deployed in vision and lidar denied environments such as foggy sewers or dusty mines. We compared results from an EKF and an incremental fixed-lag factor graph estimator using data from several real robot experiments crossing challenging terrains. Our results show a reduction of relative pose error by 37\% in challenging scenarios when compared to a traditional kinematic-inertial estimator without learned measurement. We also demonstrate a 22\% reduction in error when used with vision systems in visually degraded environments such as an underground mine.}

However, the state-of-the-art algorithms inevitably fail if the initial condition of the final control phase exceeds an orbit and spacecraft-dependent range, the so-called feasibility range. This article presents enhanced maneuver algorithms for the third (and final) control phase which ensure the overall maneuver success independent of the initial conditions. Thereby, all maneuvers which have previously been categorized as infeasible due to algorithm limitations are rendered feasible. An individual algorithm is presented for both possible control options of the final phase, namely differential lift or drag. In addition, a methodology to precisely determine the feasibility range without the need of computational expensive Monte Carlo simulations is presented. This allows fast and precise assessments of possible influences of boundary conditions, such as the orbital inclination or the maneuver altitude, on the feasibility range.},

  abstract = {Magnetically active stars possess stellar winds whose interaction with planetary magnetic fields produces radio auroral emission. We examine the detectability of radio auroral emission from Proxima b, the closest known exosolar planet orbiting our nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri. Using the Radiometric Bode's Law, we estimate the radio flux produced by the interaction of Proxima Centauri's stellar wind and Proxima b's magnetosphere for different planetary magnetic field strengths. For plausible planetary masses, Proxima b produces 6-83 mJy of auroral radio flux at frequencies of 0.3-0.8 MHz for planetary magnetic field strengths of 1-3 B\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. According to recent MHD models that vary the orbital parameters of the system, this emission is expected to be highly variable. This variability is due to large fluctuations in the size of Proxima b's magnetosphere as it crosses the equatorial streamer regions of the dense stellar wind and high dynamic pressure. Using the MHD model of Garraffo et al. 2016 for the variation of the magnetosphere radius during the orbit, we estimate that the observed radio flux can vary nearly by an order of magnitude over the 11.2 day period of Proxima b. The detailed amplitude variation depends on the stellar wind, orbital, and planetary magnetic field parameters. We discuss observing strategies for proposed future space-based observatories to reach frequencies below the ionospheric cut off (\${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ MHz) as would be required to detect the signal we investigate.},

This hyperfine transition of HI is sensitive to the thermal and ionization state of hydrogen gas and thus provides a tracer of sources of energetic photons -- primarily hot stars and accreting black holes -- which ionize and heat the high redshift intergalactic medium. Sky-averaged spectra of the redshifted 21-cm background are expected to exhibit broad absorption and emission features relative to the microwave background at low radio frequencies, {$\approx$}40-120 MHz. In a low altitude lunar orbit, night-time spectral observations while on the farside avoid terrestrial radio frequency interference, ionospheric corruption, and solar radio emissions. The distinctive frequency structure, uniformity over large scales, and unpolarized state of the redshifted 21-cm spectrum are distinct from the spectrally featureless, spatially-varying and polarized emission from bright Galactic foregrounds. This allows a clean separation between the primordial signal and foregrounds using Bayesian inference techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We illustrate how this signal can be detected in the presence of foregrounds using the instrument parameters for the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE), and to subsequently constrain the properties of the high-z intergalactic medium and the parameters of a simple first stars model.},

Based only on sequences of depth images along with action vectors and point wise data associations, SE3-Nets learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-Nets predict SE3 transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-Nets enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that SE3-Nets also work well on real data.},

Both methods present their limitations, however: GNSS signals can only be used effectively in earth orbit, and ground-based orbit determination presents an inherent latency that increases with the Earth-spacecraft distance. For spacecraft flying formations, an alternative method of orbit determination, independent of external signals, consists in the observation of the spacecraft's position with respect to the central body through the relative positioning history of the spacecraft within the formation. In this paper, the potential of the relative positioning method is demonstrated in the context of the SunRISE mission, and compared with the mission's previously proposed orbit determination methods. An optimization study is then made to find the optimal placement of a new spacecraft in the formation so as to maximize the positioning accuracy of the system. Finally, the possibility of removing part of the system's relative bearing measurements while maintaing its observability is also studied. The resulting system is found to be observable, but ill-conditioned.},

To mitigate such error, the deconvolution method is commonly used for compensating the distortion via an identified convolutional model. However, its effectiveness is limited by model inaccuracies (e.g., imprecise parameters or unmodeled distortion dynamics). In this paper, we propose a learning-based scheme to eliminate the residual calibration error by repeatedly applying the deconvolution operations. The resulting iterative deconvolution method is shown to be able to correct both linear and nonlinear model errors to the highest precision allowed by available finite sampling rates. The calibration error induced by finite sampling rates is also analyzed, from which we propose that the inter-sampling error can be suppressed by actively introducing nonlinear components in the control electronics.},

Despite these advances, MICP has been rarely applied to real-world robotic control because the solution times are still too slow for online applications. In this work, we extend the machine learning optimizer (MLOPT) framework [1, 2] to solve MICPs arising in robotics at very high speed. MLOPT encodes the combinatorial part of the optimal solution into a strategy. Using data collected from offline problem solutions, we train a multiclass classifier to predict the optimal strategy given problem-specific parameters such as states or obstacles. Compared to [2], we use task-specific strategies and prune redundant ones to significantly reduce the number of classes the predictor has to select from, thereby greatly improving scalability. Given the predicted strategy, the control task becomes a small convex optimization problem that we can solve in milliseconds. Numerical experiments on a cart-pole system with walls, a freeflying space robot and task-oriented grasps show that our method provides not only 1 to 2 orders of magnitude speedups compared to state-of-the-art solvers but also performance close to the globally optimal MICP solution.},

  abstract = {When nominally rigid bodies collide, impulse-momentum equations do not contain enough information to predict the outcome of the collision. The missing information is supplied by constitutive relations called impact laws. Since all bodies deform in impacts, `rigid bodies' are taken as models for sufficiently stiff bodies. A popular modeling approach for simultaneous multiple impacts of `rigid' bodies uses complementarity conditions at the velocity level. In the frictionless case, to which we restrict our attention, the complementarity conditions are that at each contact location, which is modeled using normal restitution e and which has a pre-collision normal relative approach velocity ViN , the normal contact impulse PN and the post-collision normal relative separation velocity Vf N satisfy PN {$\geq$} 0, Vf N - eViN {$\geq$} 0, and PN (Vf N - eViN ) = 0. The physical realism of the complementarity assumptions is investigated by studying a simple but arbitrarily stiff system theoretically for different deformation distribution regimes; a related experiment is also described. Unlike the case of noncollisional dynamics where the complementarity conditions at the acceleration level usually hold true, it is found that the complementarity conditions at the velocity level have no fundamental physical basis for collisions of even extremely stiff objects. Examples of two other well known systems are also given, where the complementarity conditions are clearly violated. These conditions should therefore be viewed as constitutive assumptions which, though algorithmically convenient, are often physically inaccurate.},

We leverage the implicit formulation for precise and exact contact modelling in DDP, where we focus on two contributions: (1) Contact dynamics in acceleration level that enables high-order integration schemes; (2) Formulation using an invertible contact model in the forward pass and a closed-form solution in the backward pass to improve the numerical resolution of contacts. The performance of the proposed framework is validated (1) by comparing implicit versus explicit DDP for the swing-up of a double pendulum, and (2) by planning motions for two tasks using a single leg model making multi-body contacts with the environment: standing up from ground, where a priori contact enumeration is challenging, and maintaining balance under an external perturbation.},

A high-level sampling-based planning framework, in tandem with a low-level inverse contact dynamics solver, effectively explores the space of continuous pushes with discrete pusher contact switch-overs. We model the frictional interaction between gripper, grasped object, and pusher, by discretizing complex surface/line contacts into arrays of hard frictional point contacts. The inverse dynamics problem of finding an instantaneous pusher motion that yields a desired instantaneous object motion takes the form of a mixed nonlinear complementarity problem. Building upon this dynamics solver, our planner generates a sequence of pushes that steers the object to a goal grasp. We evaluate the performance of the planner for the case of a parallel-jaw gripper manipulating different objects, both in simulation and with real experiments. Through these examples, we highlight the important properties of the planner: respecting and exploiting the hybrid dynamics of contact sticking/sliding/rolling and a sense of efficiency with respect to discrete contact switch-overs.},

Tendon-Driven Serpentine Manipulator (TSM) maybe among the most widely adopted and promising ones to turn robot assisted MIS into reality. But due to the high nonlinearities and model uncertainties in the TSM system, it is extremely difficult to precisely control the robot. In this paper, we develop and investigate two approaches from machine learning domain, Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and K-Nearest-Neighbors Regression (KNNR), to learn the Inverse Kinematic (IK) model of our TSM robot. Then we compare the performance of GMR and KNNR with that of an IK model derived in previous literatures. Experimental results conducted on a real world TSM robot performing trajectory tracking tasks validate the superior performance of the proposed methods over traditional analytical IK models.},

Such systems have to satisfy necessary constraints (e.g., collision avoidance) with potential uncertainties coming from either disturbed system dynamics or noisy sensor measurements. However, existing motion planning methods cannot efficiently find the robust optimal solutions under general nonlinear and non-convex settings. In this paper, we formulate such problem as chance-constrained Gaussian belief space planning and propose the constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (CILQG) algorithm as a real-time solution. In this algorithm, we iteratively calculate a Gaussian approximation of the belief and transform the chance-constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method in simulations of autonomous driving planning tasks with static and dynamic obstacles. Results show that CILQG can handle uncertainties more appropriately and has faster computation time than baseline methods.},

The stability of the technique allows the use of a large fixed time step when simulating all types of fabrics and character motions. The animations generated using this technique are strikingly realistic. Wrinkles form and disappear in a quite natural way, which is the feature that most distinguishes textile fabrics from other sheet materials. Significant improvements in both the stability and realism were made possible by overcoming the post-buckling instability as well as the numerical instability. The instability caused by buckling arises from a structural instability and therefore cannot be avoided by simply employing a semi-implicit method. Addition of a damping force may help to avoid instabilities; however, it can significantly degrade the realism of the cloth motion. The method presented here uses a particlebased physical model to handle the instability in the post-buckling response without introducing any fictitious damping.},

Jumping at small sizes requires the quick release of stored energy to accelerate the robot to its takeoff velocity. Two approaches to this energy release are considered. The first is similar to the method used by most larger jumping robots and insects; energy is stored mechanically and generates thrust against the ground upon release. A new microfabrication process incorporates polymer springs for the robot leg and the resulting 4mm {\texttimes} 4mm {\texttimes} 0.3mm jumping mechanism has been launched over 32 cm into the air by hand. The second approach utilizes stored chemical energy and generates thrust by expelling gas from a chemical reaction. This energetic material has been combined with sensing, control, and power on a 4mm {\texttimes} 7mm {\texttimes} 4mm polymer chassis, and jumps in response to light stimuli have reached 8 cm in height.},

In this paper, the actuation pulse comes from the rapid release of chemical energy to create propulsion. The actuation pulse lasts several microseconds and is achieved using a novel high-force/low-power thrust actuator, nanoporous energetic silicon, resulting in 250 {$\mu$}J of kinetic energy delivered to the robot and a vertical height of approximately 8 cm.},

Porosity of 2\,mm diameter, porous silicon microthruster devices was varied by changing the concentration of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol in an etch solution, by changing porous silicon etch depth, and by changing the resistivity of silicon wafers used for the etch process. The porosity varied from 30\% to 75\% for these experiments. The highest mean thrust and impulse values measured with a calibrated Kistler 9215 force sensor were 674 mN and 271 {$\mu$}N s, respectively, with a 73\% porosity, 2\,mm diameter porous silicon device etched in a 3\,:\,1 etch solution on a 3.6 {\textohm} cm wafer to a target etch depth of 30 {$\mu$}m. As a result of changing porosity, a 23{\texttimes}\,\,increase in thrust performance and a 36{\texttimes}\,\,increase in impulse performance was demonstrated. Impulse values were also validated using a pendulum experiment in which the porous silicon microthruster was unconstrained, but several non-linearities in the pendulum experimental setup resulted in less consistent data than when measured by the force sensor for microthrusters at this size scale. These thrust and impulse results complement previous work in determining the effect of porosity on other porous silicon reaction metrics such as flame speed.},

This approach depends only on the geometry of V, avoiding representation issues such as multiplicity and choice of generators. It also takes advantage of the coordinate ring structure to reduce the size of the corresponding semidefinite program (SDP). In addition, the input can be given as a straight-line program. Our methods are particularly appealing for varieties that are easy to sample from but for which the defining equations are complicated, such as SO(n), Grassmannians, or rank k tensors. For arbitrary varieties, we can obtain the required samples by using the tools of numerical algebraic geometry. In this way we connect the areas of SOS optimization and numerical algebraic geometry.},

Existing optimization-based approaches simulating contact between convex primitives rely on a bilevel formulation that separates collision detection and contact simulation. These approaches are unreliable in realistic contact simulation scenarios because isolating the collision detection problem introduces contact location non-uniqueness. Our approach combines contact simulation and collision detection into a unified single-level optimization problem. This disambiguates the collision detection problem in a physics-informed manner. Compared to previous differentiable simulation approaches, our formulation features improved simulation robustness and a reduction in computational complexity by more than an order of magnitude. We illustrate the contact and collision differentiability on a robotic manipulation task requiring optimization-through-contact. We provide a numerically efficient implementation of our formulation in the Julia language called Silico.jl.},

These dynamics enable the upper-level planning problem to reason about contact timing and forces, and generate entirely new contact-mode sequences online. To achieve reliable and fast numerical convergence, we devise a structure-exploiting interior-point solver for these LCP contact dynamics and a custom trajectory optimizer for the tracking problem. We demonstrate real-time solution rates for CI-MPC and the ability to generate and track non-periodic behaviours in hardware experiments on a quadrupedal robot. We also show that the controller is robust to model mismatch and can respond to disturbances by discovering and exploiting new contact modes across a variety of robotic systems in simulation, including a pushbot, planar hopper, planar quadruped, and planar biped.},

  abstract = {This paper explores single-satellite single-pass geolocation of terrestrial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing signals from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). GNSS spoofers transmit an ensemble of false GNSS signals intending that the victim(s) receiver will accept them as authentic signals and infer a false position fix and/or a clock offset. Receivers in LEO provide a unique opportunity to detect, classify, and geolocate terrestrial GNSS interference. Single-satellite-based transmitter geolocation is possible from Doppler measurements alone, assuming a carrier can be extracted from an interference signal. There are proven single-satellite Doppler-based geolocation algorithms, but they only apply to emitters transmitting at a constant frequency. By contrast, GNSS spoofers transmit signals whose carrier frequency contains an unknown time-varying frequency component that imitates the Doppler corresponding to each individual spoofed navigation satellite. This paper develops a single-pass single-satellite technique that removes the unknown time-varying frequency component added by GNSS spoofers so that a Doppler (range-rate) time history can be extracted for geolocation. It is shown that the true range rate between the terrestrial spoofer and LEO-based receiver manifests in the spoofed receiver clock offset rate estimate. Monte Carlo simulations are developed that investigate how transmitter motion, transmitter clock offset rate, and spoofed clock offset rate affect geolocation accuracy. The proposed method is validated by simulating the reception of terrestrial GNSS spoofing signals on a LEO-based receiver and achieving under 10 km accuracy. Additionally, recent real-world GPS spoofing signals captured by a LEO-based receiver are analyzed.},

  abstract = {This paper explores two-step and direct geolocation of terrestrial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Within the past decade, there has been a sharp increase in GNSS outages due to deliberate GNSS jamming. Receivers in LEO are uniquely situated to detect, classify, and geolocate terrestrial GNSS jammers. The conventional two-step geolocation method first estimates the differential delay and differential Doppler, then uses a time history of these to estimate the transmitter location. By contrast, direct geolocation is a single-step search over a geographical grid that enables estimation of the transmitter location directly from the observed signals. Signals from narrowband, matched-code, and chirp jammers recently captured in the GNSS frequency bands by two time-synchronized LEO receivers over the Eastern Mediterranean are analyzed and the emitters geolocated. It is demonstrated that the direct approach is effective even for low signal-to-noise ratio interference signals based on short captures with multiple emitters. Moreover, the direct approach enables geolocation of multiple emitters with cyclostationary signals (e.g., chirp jammers), whereas the two-step method struggles in such cases to associate emitters with their corresponding structures in differential delay and Doppler space.},

  abstract = {An appropriate choice of contact forces for anthropomorphic robotic grasping devices is important for achieving a balanced grasp. Too little applied force may cause an object to slip or be dropped, and too much applied force may cause damage to delicate objects. Prior methods of grasping force optimization (GFO) in the literature can be difficult to compare due to variability in the parameters, such as the type of grasping device, the object grasped, and the contact model, among other factors. Additionally, methods are typically tested on a very small number of scenarios and may not be as robust in other settings. This paper presents a detailed analysis of three optimization approaches based on the literature, comparing them on the basis of accuracy and computational efficiency. Numerical examples are provided for three types of grasp commonly performed by the human hand (cylindrical grasp, tip grasp, and tripod grasp) using both soft finger (SF) contact and hard finger (HF) contact friction models. For each method and grasping example, an external force is applied to the object in eighteen different directions to provide a more complete picture of the methods' performance. Contact points between the hand and the object are predetermined (given). A comparison of the results showed that the nonlinear and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approaches perform best in terms of accuracy, while the computational efficiency of the linear method is stronger unless the number of contact points and segments becomes too large. In this case, the nonlinear method performs more quickly. Future work will extend the problem of GFO to real-time implementation, and a related work (briefly addressed here) examines the sensitivity of optimization methods to variability in the contact locations.},

Thanks to efficient optimization techniques, we allow virtual soft robot morphogenesis with at least four orders of magnitude more variables and fewer iterations as compared to previous work based on genetic algorithms. We demonstrate generation of a soft robot at a resolution of 1003 and 2 million parameters. We extend our approach to generate rigid structure and create a multi rigidity robot. Finally, we introduce a concept of energy fraction to limit muscle mass.},

  abstract = {The capability to orient the solar arrays of a spacecraft toward the Sun is an ultimate asset for any attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS). This ability should be maintained in any operative circumstance, either nominal or off-nominal, to avoid the loss of the entire space-borne system. The safe mode implementation should guarantee a positive power generation from the solar arrays, regardless of the health status of the satellite platform. This paper presents a solar array pointing algorithm, to be executed on-board, with a minimal set of sensors and actuators. In fact, the sensors are limited to the solar arrays, exploiting the current/voltage sensing capacity of the electrical power subsystem to measure the Sun angle with respect to the arrays normal, and to the angular rates sensors. The actuators are required to provide a torque only along two axes and, thus, a reduced actuation capacity is still manageable by the proposed algorithm. The paper describes the algorithm, both in the Sun direction determination and in the Sun pointing control capacity. The achieved performance is outlined, considering either an ideal system or a realistic one, being the latter affected by sensors and actuators limitations. The actuation by means of momentum exchange devices or magnetic torquers is discussed, with the purpose to prove the wide applicability range of the presented algorithm, which is capable to guarantee solar array orientation with a minimal hardware set.},

This method is based on using trajectory data to determine values of a form of converse Lyapunov function at a finite number of point in the state-space. Least absolute deviations is then used to fit this data to a Sumof-Squares polynomial whose level sets then become estimates for the region of attraction. This learned Lyapunov function can then be used to predict whether newly generated initial conditions lie in the region of attraction. Extensive numerical testing is used to show that the method correctly predicts whether a new initial condition is within the region of attraction of the nonlinear ODE on over 95\% of a generated set of test data.},

Energyharvesting devices allow maintenance-free deployment in extreme environments, but requires a power system to provide the right amount of energy when an application needs it. Existing systems must provision energy capacity statically based on an application's peak demand which compromises efficiency and responsiveness when not at peak demand. This work presents Capybara: a co-designed hardware/software power system with dynamically reconfigurable energy storage capacity that meets varied application energy demand. The Capybara software interface allows programmers to specify the energy mode of an application task. Capybara's runtime system reconfigures Capybara's hardware energy capacity to match application demand. Capybara also allows a programmer to write reactive application tasks that pre-allocate a burst of energy that it can spend in response to an asynchronous (e.g., external) event. We instantiated Capybara's hardware design in two EH devices and implemented three reactive sensing applications using its software interface. Capybara improves event detection accuracy by 2x-4x over statically-provisioned energy capacity, maintains response latency within 1.5x of a continuously-powered baseline, and enables reactive applications that are intractable with existing power systems.},

We address two main challenges in computer vision for robotics: robust performance in complex scenes, and low latency for real-time operation. We achieve robust performance with Iterative Clustering Estimation (ICE), a novel algorithm that iteratively combines feature clustering with robust pose estimation. Feature clustering quickly partitions the scene and produces object hypotheses. The hypotheses are used to further refine the feature clusters, and the two steps iterate until convergence. ICE is easy to parallelize, and easily integrates single- and multi-camera object recognition and pose estimation. We also introduce a novel object hypothesis scoring function based on M-estimator theory, and a novel pose clustering algorithm that robustly handles recognition outliers. We achieve scalability and low latency with an improved feature matching algorithm for large databases, a GPU/CPU hybrid architecture that exploits parallelism at all levels, and an optimized resource scheduler. We provide extensive experimental results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in terms of recognition, scalability, and latency in real-world robotic applications.}

We present a low-communication distributed filtering scheme targeted at small-satellite formations that are limited by inter-satellite communication chan-nel capacity. We assume a chief-deputy topology, similar to the proposed NASA Helioswarm mission. Our novel state-estimation framework is based on decoupling the chief state estimation filter from the deputies and using two separate filter architectures: one chief-specific that accounts for intermittent access to inertial position measurements, and a second deputy-specific one that only incorporates relative range measurements between the spacecraft, having the chief state as an external model input. We introduce a consider-covariance technique to account for the chief's state uncertainty in the deputy's filter. We demonstrate that the proposed distributed filter architecture requires significantly less communication than prior consensus-based methods in the literature while achieving comparable accuracy.},

Discontinuous dynamical systems arise in a large number of applications, including optimal control, nonsmooth mechanics, and robotic manipulation. Independently of the particular application, one always faces similar questions when dealing with discontinuous dynamical systems. The most basic one is the notion of solution. We begin by introducing the notions of Caratheodory, Filippov and sample-and-hold solutions, discuss existence and uniqueness results for them, and examine various examples. We also give specific pointers to other notions of solution defined in the literature. Once the notion of solution has been settled, we turn our attention to the analysis of stability of discontinuous systems. We introduce the concepts of generalized gradient of locally Lipschitz functions and proximal subdifferential of lower semicontinuous functions. Building on these notions, we establish monotonic properties of candidate Lyapunov functions along the solutions. These results are key in providing suitable generalizations of Lyapunov stability theorems and the LaSalle Invariance Principle. We illustrate the applicability of these results in a class of nonsmooth gradient flows.},

In this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these extremes. We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much simpler. By treating the dynamics of the robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a target. We further require that the robot's COM and angular momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics. This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque. We demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a quadrupedal robot. Additionally, we show that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact sequence by exploiting the complementarity conditions between contact forces and contact distance.},

When entering a planetary or lunar atmosphere, a satellite with a high ratio of surface area to mass tends to decelerate at higher altitudes and thus incur less aerodynamic heating. This is the effect of a well-known parameter called the ballistic coefficient. For extremely low values of ballistic coefficient, it may be possible to enter an atmosphere without an extensive thermal protection system. In this paper we discuss chip-scale spacecraft and simulate them entering all of the significant atmospheres of the solar system: Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn's moon Titan. A chip-scale satellite could provide sought-after data for planetary atmospheres, especially the tenuous upper atmospheres that are difficult to study using radio occultation. This study introduces a low-cost architecture to obtain useful scientific data about upper atmospheres and reentry itself. Practical challenges associated with the design concept are also discussed.},

  abstract = {3D garment capture is an important component for various applications such as free-view point video, virtual avatars, online shopping, and virtual cloth fitting. Due to the complexity of the deformations, capturing 3D garment shapes requires controlled and specialized setups. A viable alternative is image-based garment capture. Capturing 3D garment shapes from a single image, however, is a challenging problem and the current solutions come with assumptions on the lighting, camera calibration, complexity of human or mannequin poses considered, and more importantly a stable physical state for the garment and the underlying human body. In addition, most of the works require manual interaction and exhibit high run-times. We propose a new technique that overcomes these limitations, making garment shape estimation from an image a practical approach for dynamic garment capture. Starting from synthetic garment shape data generated through physically based simulations from various human bodies in complex poses obtained through Mocap sequences, and rendered under varying camera positions and lighting conditions, our novel method learns a mapping from rendered garment images to the underlying 3D garment model. This is achieved by training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN-s) to estimate 3D vertex displacements from a template mesh with a specialized loss function. We illustrate that this technique is able to recover the global shape of dynamic 3D garments from a single image under varying factors such as challenging human poses, self occlusions, various camera poses and lighting conditions, at interactive rates. Improvement is shown if more than one view is integrated. Additionally, we show applications of our method to videos.},

  abstract = {Deep learning inference on embedded devices is a burgeoning field with myriad applications because tiny embedded devices are omnipresent. But we must overcome major challenges before we can benefit from this opportunity. Embedded processors are severely resource constrained. Their nearest mobile counterparts exhibit at least a 100 -- 1,000x difference in compute capability, memory availability, and power consumption. As a result, the machine-learning (ML) models and associated ML inference framework must not only execute efficiently but also operate in a few kilobytes of memory. Also, the embedded devices' ecosystem is heavily fragmented. To maximize efficiency, system vendors often omit many features that commonly appear in mainstream systems, including dynamic memory allocation and virtual memory, that allow for cross-platform interoperability. The hardware comes in many flavors (e.g., instruction-set architecture and FPU support, or lack thereof). We introduce TensorFlow Lite Micro (TF Micro), an open-source ML inference framework for running deep-learning models on embedded systems. TF Micro tackles the efficiency requirements imposed by embedded-system resource constraints and the fragmentation challenges that make cross-platform interoperability nearly impossible. The framework adopts a unique interpreter-based approach that provides flexibility while overcoming these challenges. This paper explains the design decisions behind TF Micro and describes its implementation details. Also, we present an evaluation to demonstrate its low resource requirement and minimal run-time performance overhead.},

Specifically, in this paper we demonstrate how to perform backpropagation analytically through a physical simulator defined via a linear complementarity problem.  Unlike traditional finite difference methods, such gradients can be computed analytically, which allows for greater flexibility of the engine. Through experiments in diverse domains, we highlight the system's ability to learn physical parameters from data, efficiently match and simulate observed visual behavior, and readily enable control via gradient-based planning methods.

  abstract = {This paper derives an IMU-GPS-fused inertial navigation observer for a mobile robot using the theory of invariant observer design. One of the main features of invariant observers for invariant systems on Lie groups is that the estimation error is autonomous, hence the observable state variables can be rendered convergent within a domain of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory. The Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (In-EKF) which is an extension of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is supposed to be more efficient given that the system converges to constant values on a larger set of trajectories as opposed to the equilibrium points that an EKF is based on. This paper explores the implementation of the In-EKF for robot localization and is compared against an implementation of the EKF. The localization is performed on the University of Michigan north campus long-term vision and LIDAR dataset.}

During these epochs, early stars and black holes heated and ionized the IGM, introducing fluctuations in 21 cm emission. HERA is designed to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain the timing and morphology of reionization, the properties of the first galaxies, the evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of heating. The full HERA instrument will be a 350-element interferometer in South Africa consisting of 14-m parabolic dishes observing from 50 to 250 MHz. Currently, 19 dishes have been deployed on site and the next 18 are under construction. HERA has been designated as an SKA Precursor instrument. In this paper, we summarize HERA's scientific context and provide forecasts for its key science results. After reviewing the current state of the art in foreground mitigation, we use the delay-spectrum technique to motivate high-level performance requirements for the HERA instrument. Next, we present the HERA instrument design, along with the subsystem specifications that ensure that HERA meets its performance requirements. Finally, we summarize the schedule and status of the project. We conclude by suggesting that, given the realities of foreground contamination, currentgeneration 21 cm instruments are approaching their sensitivity limits. HERA is designed to bring both the sensitivity and the precision to deliver its primary science on the basis of proven foreground filtering techniques, while developing new subtraction techniques to unlock new capabilities. The result will be a major step toward realizing the widely recognized scientific potential of 21 cm cosmology.},

  abstract = {The problem of handling contact is central to the task of controlling a walking robot. Robots can only move through the world by exerting forces on their environment, and choosing where, when, and how to touch the world is the fundamental challenge of locomotion. Because the space of possible contacts is a high-dimensional mix of discrete and continuous decisions, it has historically been difficult or impossible to make complex contact decisions online at control rates. This work first presents an approach to contact planning which is able to make some guarantees of global optimality through mixed-integer programming. That method is applied successfully to a humanoid robot in laboratory conditions, but proves difficult to rely on when the robot is experiences unmodeled disturbances. To overcome those limitations, this thesis also introduces LVIS (Learning from Value Interval Sampling) a new approach to the control of walking robots which allows complex contact decisions to be made online using a cost function trained from offline trajectory optimizations. The LVIS algorithm is demonstrated on a simple cart-pole system with walls as well as a simplified bipedal robot model, and its success at allowing both models to use contact decisions to recover from external disturbances is demonstrated in simulation.},

We aim to remove the barriers to entry into this field by presenting existing results and future challenges using a unified language and within a coherent framework. Indeed, the main difficulty in entering this field is the wide variability of terminology and scientific backgrounds, making it quite hard to acquire a comprehensive view on the topic. Another limiting factor is that it is not obvious where to draw a clear line between the limitations imposed by the technology not being mature yet and the challenges intrinsic to this class of robots. In this work, we argue that the intrinsic effects are the continuum or multi-body dynamics, the presence of a non-negligible elastic potential field, and the variability in sensing and actuation strategies.},

This paper presents a novel approach for uncertainty propagation during entry, descent and landing that relies on a new sum-of-squares robust verification technique. Unlike risk-based and probabilistic approaches, our technique does not rely on any probabilistic assumptions. It uses a set-based description to bound uncertainties and disturbances like vehicle and atmospheric parameters and winds. The approach leverages a recently developed sampling-based version of sum-of-squares programming to compute regions of finite time invariance, commonly refered to as ``invariant funnels''. We apply this approach to a three-degree-of-freedom entry vehicle model and test it using a Mars Science Laboratory reference trajectory. We compute tight approximations of robust invariant funnels that are guaranteed to reach a goal region with increased landing accuracy while respecting realistic thermal constraints.},

This uncertainty set is used to tighten the constraints in the predictive control formulation via a chance constrained approach, thereby providing a probabilistic guarantee of constraint satisfaction. The parameterized form of the controllers produced by EPC coupled with online uncertainty estimates ensures this robust constraint satisfaction property persists even as the system switches controllers and experiences variations in the uncertainty model. We validate the online performance and robust constraint satisfaction of the proposed Robust EPC algorithm through a series of experimental trials with a small quadrotor platform subjected to changes in state estimate quality.},

A planar dynamic model is used to evaluate pitch-up maneuvers and determine suspension parameters that satisfy constraints on the contact forces for a range of flight velocities.

  abstract = {A magnetometer is essential in spacecraft magnetic attitude control due to the need for magnetic field information to compute the control command. The measurements of the magnetometer, however, are usually affected by other electric currents in the spacecraft, especially those of the magnetic coils when they are turned on during actuation. As a result, magnetic rods and magnetometers are usually turned on at alternate times, resulting in a reduced duty cycle of the magnetic rods, and hence longer maneuver times. This paper presents a magnetic attitude control system with extended duty cycle and low magnetometer measurements frequency. Instead of measurements, a computed magnetic field strength vector is used for updating the control command during the duty cycle. Using the measured spacecraft rotational motion, and knowing the control torque command, it is possible to compute the magnetic field strength vector. These computations are corrected using magnetometer measurements at a lower rate. The Tikhonov regularization approach is implemented to solve the singular magnetic torque system. This algorithm is demonstrated via Monte Carlo numerical simulations to have faster attitude maneuvers and lower power consumption by the magnetic rods. Real data obtained from the Cascade Smallsat and Ionospheric Polar Explorer spacecraft are used for validation of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {This study focused on providing applicable control solutions for spacecraft magnetic attitude control system. Basically, two main lines are pursued; first, developing detumbling control laws and second, an improvement in the three-axis attitude control schemes by extending magnetic rods activation time. Spacecraft, after separation from the launching mechanism, experiences a tumbling phase due to an undesired angular momentum. In this study, we present a new efficient variant of the B-dot detumbling law by introducing a substitute of the spacecraft angular velocity, based on the ambient magnetic field data. This B-dot law preserves the orthogonality, among the applied torque, dipole moment and magnetic field vectors. Most of the existing variants of the B-dot law in the literature don't preserve this orthogonality. Furthermore, the problem of minimum-time spacecraft magnetic detumbling is revisited within the context of optimal control theory. Two formulations are presented; the first one assumes the availability of the angular velocity measurements for feedback. The second formulation assumes the availability of only the ambient magnetic field measurements in the feedback; the latter is considered another optimal-based B-dot law. A reduction in detumbling time is fulfilled by the proposed laws along with less power consumption for the proposed B-dot laws. In magnetic attitude maneuvers, magnetic rods and magnetometers usually operate alternatively, to avoid the magnetic rods' noise effect on magnetometers measurements. Because of that, there will be no control authority over the spacecraft during the magnetometer measurement period. Hence longer maneuver times are usually experienced. In this study, a control scheme that enables the extension of the magnetic rods' activation time is developed, regardless of the attitude control law. The key concept is replacing the real magnetic field measurement by a pseudo measurement, which is computed based on other sensors measurements. By applying a known command to the spacecraft and measuring the spacecraft response, it is possible to compute the ambient magnetic field around the spacecraft. The system mathematical singularity is solved using the Tikhonov regularization approach. Another developed approach estimates the magnetic field, using a relatively simple and fast dynamic model inside a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter. A less maneuver time with less power consumption are fulfilled. These control approaches are further validated using real telemetry data from CASSIOPE mission. This dissertation develops a stability analysis for the spacecraft magnetic attitude control, taking into consideration the alternate operation between the magnetic rods and the magnetometers. It is shown that the system stability degrades because of this alternate operation, supporting the proposed approach of extending the operation time of the magnetic rods.},

The B-dot control law is a torque projection-based controller, however, it is not guaranteed to have the dipole moment orthogonal to the magnetic field, especially as the angular velocity gets smaller during detumbling, resulting in a suboptimal torque vector. This paper presents a new variant of the B-dot control. By computing an equivalent angular velocity, based on the magnetic field data, it is possible to develop a control law that guarantees the magnetic dipole moment to remain in the plane orthogonal to the ambient magnetic field. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the proposed B-dot control is compared to two other variants of B-dot control laws: a simple B-dot control and a recent variable gain B-dot control. The results show that the proposed B-dot control outperforms the other B-dot control laws in terms of the speed of detumbling and the power consumption.},

Two formulations are presented; the first one assumes the availability of the angular velocity measurements for feedback. The second formulation assumes the availability of only the ambient magnetic field measurements in the feedback. In both formulations, the constraint in this optimal control problem is a limit on the maximum magnetic dipole moment of the magnetic rods. It is shown that the time optimality will be achieved if the triple orthogonality condition between the torque, the dipole moment, and the magnetic field vector is fulfilled. This triple orthogonality is considered as a condition of optimality, which is often neglected in the existing B-dot law and its variants in the literature. The Pontryagin minimum principle is used to derive analytically the control logic, for each formulation, in this nonautonomous system, under the assumption of high angular velocity. The second formulation is shown to yield a new variant of the B-dot law. The Monte Carlo simulation results presented in this paper confirm that the two controls found in both formulations outperform most existing algorithms. In addition, the results show lower power consumption by the magnetic rods when using the proposed variant of the B-dot law as compared to existing B-dot laws.},

The operation of the magnetic actuators is usually on a duty cycle; during the off times in this duty cycle the magnetometers are used to measure the magnetic field around the spacecraft. This alternate operation of magnetic actuators and sensors avoids the noise effect on the magnetometers coming from the magnetic actuators. This alternate operation results in longer maneuver times. This paper presents an estimation approach for the magnetic field, as well as the spacecraft attitude, that increases the duty cycle of the magnetic rods while reducing the rate of collecting the magnetometer data. A modified Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) is used in the proposed approach. A relatively simple and fast dynamic model is developed for use in the MEKF. Monte Carlo simulations presented in this paper show that the proposed approach results in less maneuver time, and less power consumption by the magnetic rods when compared to a standard magnetic control approach.

Despite using a simplified model, the robot is capable of robust locomotion at a variety of speeds. Experimental results demonstrate control of gaits including stand, trot, flying-trot, pronk, bound, pace, a 3-legged gait, and a full 3D gallop. The robot achieved forward speeds of up to 3 m/s, lateral speeds up to 1 m/s, and angular speeds up to 180 deg/sec.

With a carefully chosen configuration error function, the MPC control law is transcribed into a Quadratic Program (QP) which can be solved efficiently in realtime. Our formulation can stabilize a wide range of periodic quadrupedal gaits and acrobatic maneuvers. We show various simulation as well as experimental results to validate our control strategy.

  abstract = {Constellation deployment using on-board propulsion is a cost-effective way for distributing multiple satellites into different orbital planes using a minimal number of launches. This paper focuses on the extension of previous studies based on analytical formulations of the problem into a more general numerically-based one, which can be applied to both electric and chemical propulsion systems. Additionally, the formulation is not restricted to in-plane maneuvers only, taking full advantage of the increased mobility capabilities of satellites equipped with high-efficiency propulsion systems. Two deployment methods are analyzed: the first is based on moving the satellites from the injection to the operational orbit sequentially with a properly timed delay between each maneuver so that the difference in nodal regression causes the accumulation of a given spacing; the second is built upon the parallel transfer of satellites into so called ``drift'' orbits which, once again, exploiting the differential nodal drift, can be used to accumulate orbital plane spacing until a required value is met, and the satellites can be finally moved into their operational orbits. A multi-objective optimization based on the high-fidelity numerical computation of maneuvers using a feedback control law coupled with a genetic algorithm is proposed, presenting a framework capable of generating optimal solutions with respect to total constellation propellant mass needs and deployment time. An example of application based on the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission is presented. The results highlight the potential of the optimization routine which is intended to be applied systematically by mission designers to generate solutions for the deployment problem within the context of constellation design. Some important and un-explored properties of the problem, such as, launcher-related injection constraints, the selection of a suitable propulsion technology and the effects of atmospheric drag are analyzed. The results show the effect of these properties on the optimality of the solutions, and highlight the advantage of a mixed in-plane/out-of-plane maneuver approach.},

ECOS is written in low footprint, single-threaded, library-free ANSI-C and so runs on most embedded platforms. The main interior-point algorithm is a standard primal-dual Mehrotra predictor-corrector method with Nesterov-Todd scaling and self-dual embedding, with search directions found via a symmetric indefinite KKT system, chosen to allow stable factorization with a fixed pivoting order. The indefinite system is solved using Davis' SparseLDL package, which we modify by adding dynamic regularization and iterative refinement for stability and reliability, as is done in the CVXGEN code generation system, allowing us to avoid all numerical pivoting; the elimination ordering is found entirely symbolically. This keeps the solver simple, only 750 lines of code, with virtually no variation in run time. For small problems, ECOS is faster than most existing SOCP solvers; it is still competitive for mediumsized problems up to tens of thousands of variables.},

  abstract = {Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.},

  abstract = {Planning locomotion trajectories for legged microrobots is challenging because of their complex morphology, high frequency passive dynamics, and discontinuous contact interactions with their environment. Consequently, such research is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots. We develop a threedimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 g quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15\% faster than previously measured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute a vertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78\% of the microrobot's center-of-mass height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end demonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on a millimeter-scale legged microrobot.},

  abstract = {Accurate and stable spacecraft pointing is a requirement of many astronomical observations. Pointing particularly challenges nanosatellites because of an unfavorable surface area--to-mass ratio and a proportionally large volume required for even the smallest attitude control systems. This work explores the limitations on astrophysical attitude knowledge and control in a regime unrestricted by actuator precision or actuator-induced disturbances such as jitter. The external disturbances on an archetypal 6U CubeSat are modeled, and the limiting sensing knowledge is calculated from the available stellar flux and grasp of a telescope within the available volume. These inputs are integrated using a model-predictive control scheme. For a simple test case at 1 Hz, with an 85-mm telescope and a single 11th magnitude star, the achievable body pointing is predicted to be 0.39 arcseconds. For a more general limit, integrating available star light, the achievable attitude sensing is approximately 1 milliarcsecond, which leads to a predicted body pointing accuracy of 20 milliarcseconds after application of the control model. These results show significant room for attitude sensing and control systems to improve before astrophysical and environmental limits are reached.},

The customized code is generated for a given problem structure and makes use of no dynamic memory allocation, minimizes branching, wastes no mathematical or logical computations, and has minimal dependencies to standard libraries. The resulting software is designed to be easy to implement on embedded hardware with limited computing capabilities, while still providing accurate results rapidly enough for real-time use. The core IPM algorithm is a fairly standard primal-dual IPM, which makes use of Mehrotra predictor-corrector method with Nesterov-Todd scalings and Newton search directions. We make use of the Approximate Minimum Degree heuristic to maximize the sparsity of the Cholesky factorizations that are ultimately used to solve for the search directions. We conclude the paper by presenting the computational performance results from two example problems: a Mars landing optimal control problem and a reaction wheel allocation problem. The code generated for the Mars landing problem was successfully validated in three flights onboard a NASA test rocket, and was used in real-time to generate the optimal landing trajectories that guided the rocket. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that a real-time embedded convex optimization algorithm was used to control such a large vehicle, where mission success and safety critically relied on the real-time optimization algorithm.},

The efficient Newton implementation scheme proposed here is similar to Mayne's DDP (differential dynamic programming) method but produces the Newton step exactly, even when the dynamical equations are nonlinear. The proposed scheme is also related to a Riccati treatment of the linear, two-point boundary-value problems that characterize optimal solutions. For discrete-time problems, the dynamic programming approach and the Riccati substitution differ in an interesting way; however, these differences essentially vanish in the continuous-time limit.},

  abstract = {For motion planning and veri cation, as well as for model-based control, it is important to have an accurate dynamic system model. In many cases, friction is a signi cant component of the model. When considering the solution of the rigid-body forward dynamics problem in systems such as robots, we can often appeal to the fundamental theorem of di erential equations to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. It is known, however, that when Coulomb friction is added to the dynamic equations, the forward dynamic solution may not exist and if it exists, it is not necessarily unique. In these situations, the inverse dynamic problem is ill-posed as well. Thus there is the need to understand the nature of the existence and uniqueness problems and to know under what conditions these problems arise. In this paper, we show that even single degree of freedom systems can exhibit existence and uniqueness problems. Next, we introduce compliance in the otherwise rigid-body model. This has two e ects. First, the forward and inverse problems become well-posed. Thus we are guaranteed unique solutions. Secondly, we show that the extra dynamic solutions associated with the rigid model are unstable.},

To approximately solve the stochastic dynamic programming problem that is associated with DUE planning, we present a partially closed-loop receding horizon control algorithm whose solution integrates prediction, estimation, and planning while also accounting for chance constraints that arise from the uncertain locations of the robot and obstacles. Simulation results in simple static and dynamic scenarios illustrate the benefit of the algorithm over classical approaches. The approach is also applied to more complicated scenarios, including agents with complex, multimodal behaviors, basic robot-agent interaction, and agent information gathering.},

We consider the problem of scheduling image collections, ground contacts, sun-pointed periods for battery recharging, and data recorder management for an agile, resource-constrained Earth-observing spacecraft. By considering multiple mission objectives simultaneously, the algorithm is able to find optimized task schedule that satisfies all operational constraints in a single planning step, thus reducing the operational complexity and number of steps involved in mission planning. We present two solution approaches based on forward search and Monte Carlo Tree search. We baseline against rule-based, graph search, and mixed-integer-linear programming approaches. The SMDP formulation is evaluated in both single-objective and multi-objective scenarios. The SMDP solution is found to perform comparably with the baseline methods at greatly increased speed in single-objective scenarios and greater schedule reward in multi-objective.},

  abstract = {Operating Earth observing satellites requires efficient planning methods that coordinate activities of multiple spacecraft. The satellite task planning problem entails selecting actions that best satisfy mission objectives for autonomous execution. Task scheduling is often performed by human operators assisted by heuristic or rule-based planning tools. This approach does not efficiently scale to multiple assets as heuristics frequently fail to properly coordinate actions of multiple vehicles over long horizons. Additionally, the problem becomes more difficult to solve for large constellations as the complexity of the problem scales exponentially in the number of requested observations and linearly in the number of spacecraft. It is expected that new commercial optical and radar imaging constellations will require automated planning methods to meet stated responsiveness and throughput objectives. This paper introduces a new approach for solving the satellite scheduling problem by generating an infeasibility-based graph representation of the problem and finding a maximal independent set of vertices for the graph. The approach is tested on a scenarios of up to 10,000 requested imaging locations for the Skysat constellation of optical satellites as well as simulated constellations of up to 24 satellites. Performance is compared with contemporary graph-traversal and mixed-integer linear programming approaches. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in both the solution time along with the number of scheduled collections beyond baseline methods. For large problems, the maximum independent set approach is able find a feasible schedule with 8\% more collections in 75\% less time.},

  abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft is being designed to carry a large rover ({$>$} 800 kg) to the surface of Mars using a blunt-body entry capsule as the primary decelerator. The spacecraft is being designed for launch in 2009 and arrival at Mars in 2010. The combination of large mass and diameter with non-zero angle-of-attack for MSL will result in unprecedented convective heating environments caused by turbulence prior to peak heating. Navier-Stokes computations predict a large turbulent heating augmentation for which there are no supporting flight data1 and little ground data for validation. Consequently, an extensive experimental program has been established specifically for MSL to understand the level of turbulent augmentation expected in flight. The experimental data support the prediction of turbulent transition and have also uncovered phenomena that cannot be replicated with available computational methods. The result is that the flight aeroheating environments predictions must include larger uncertainties than are typically used2 for a Mars entry capsule. Finally, the thermal protection system (TPS) being used for MSL has not been flown at the heat flux, pressure, and shear stress combinations expected in flight, so a test program has been established to obtain conditions relevant to flight. This paper summarizes the aerothermodynamic definition analysis and TPS development, focusing on the challenges that are unique to MSL.},

The traditional variance approximation is \$1/{\textbackslash}mathscr\{J\}\_{\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\$, where \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\$ is the maximum likelihood estimator and J{\texttheta} is the expected total Fisher information. Many writers, including R. A. Fisher, have argued in favour of the variance estimate 1/I(x), where I(x) is the observed information, i.e. minus the second derivative of the log likelihood function at \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\$ given data x. We give a frequentist justification for preferring 1/I(x) to \$1/{\textbackslash}mathscr\{J\}\_{\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\$. The former is shown to approximate the conditional variance of \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}theta\$ given an appropriate ancillary statistic which to a first approximation is I(x). The theory may be seen to flow naturally from Fisher's pioneering papers on likelihood estimation. A large number of examples are used to supplement a small amount of theory. Our evidence indicates preference for the likelihood ratio method of obtaining confidence limits.},

  abstract = {Inertial navigation represents a unique method of navigation, in which there is no dependency on external sources of information. As opposed to other position fixing navigation techniques, inertial navigation performs the navigation in a relative sense with respect to the initial navigation state of the moving platform. Hence, inertial navigation systems are not prone to jamming, or spoofing. Inertial navigation systems have developed vastly, from their occurrence in the 1940s up to date. The accuracy of the inertial sensors has improved over time, making inertial sensors sufficient in terms of size, weight, cost, and accuracy for navigation and guidance applications. Within the past few years, inertial sensors have developed from being purely mechanical into incorporating various technologies and taking advantage of numerous physical phenomena, from which the dynamic forces exerted on a moving body could be computed accurately. Besides, the evolution of inertial navigation scheme involved the evolution from stable-platform inertial navigation system, which were mechanically complicated, to computationally demanding strap-down inertial navigation systems. Optical sensory technologies have provided highly accurate inertial sensors, at smaller sizes. Besides, the vibratory inertial navigation technologies enabled the production of Micro-electro-machined inertial sensors that are extremely low-cost, and offer extremely low size, weight and power consumption, making them suitable for a wide range of day-to-day navigation applications. Recently, advanced inertial sensor technologies have been introduced to the industry such as nuclear magnetic resonance technology, cold-atom technology, and the re-introduction of fluid-based inertial sensors. On another note, inertial sensor errors constitute a huge research aspect in which it is intended for inertial sensors to reach level in which they could operate for substantially long operation times in the absence of updates from aiding sensors, which would be a huge leap. Inertial sensors error modeling techniques have been developing rapidly trying to ensure higher levels of navigation accuracy using lower-cost inertial sensors. In this review, the inertial sensor technologies are covered extensively, along the future trends in the inertial sensors' technologies. Besides, this review covers a brief overview on the inertial error modeling techniques used to enhance the performance of low-cost sensors.}

  abstract = {Space free-flyers like the Astrobee robots currently operating aboard the International Space Station must operate with inherent system uncertainties. Parametric uncertainties like mass and moment of inertia are especially important to quantify in these safety-critical space systems and can change in scenarios such as on-orbit cargo movement, where unknown grappled payloads significantly change the system dynamics. Cautiously learning these uncertainties en route can potentially avoid time- and fuel-consuming pure system identification maneuvers. Recognizing this, this work proposes RATTLE, an online information-aware motion planning algorithm that explicitly weights parametric model-learning coupled with real-time replanning capability that can take advantage of improved system models. The method consists of a two-tiered (global and local) planner, a low-level model predictive controller, and an online parameter estimator that produces estimates of the robot's inertial properties for more informed control and replanning on-the-fly; all levels of the planning and control feature online update-able models. Simulation results of RATTLE for the Astrobee free-flyer grappling an uncertain payload are presented alongside results of a hardware demonstration showcasing the ability to explicitly encourage model parametric learning while achieving otherwise useful motion.},

The model combines and generalizes two ideas: a bed of springs (an "elastic foundation") and hydrostatic pressure. In this model, continuous pressure fields are computed offline for the interior of each nominally rigid object. Unlike hydrostatics or elastic foundations, the pressure fields need not satisfy mechanical equilibrium conditions. When two objects nominally overlap, a contact surface is defined where the two pressure fields are equal. This static pressure is supplemented with a dissipative rate-dependent pressure and friction to determine tractions on the contact surface. The contact wrench between pairs of objects is an integral of traction contributions over this surface. The model evaluates much faster than elasticity-theory models, while showing the essential trends of force, moment, and stiffness increase with contact load. It yields continuous wrenches even for non-convex objects and coarse meshes. The method shows promise as sufficiently fast, accurate, and robust for design-in-simulation of robot controllers.},

We think that using a basketball as a spherical tire is low-cost and advantageous. Next, we describe how to calculate torque and angular velocity, which motors generate to roll a basketball. They are needed for driving motors and dynamic simulations. Finally, we propose an interface to operate the vehicle. One, who rides on the vehicle, can move to all directions by shifting one's center of mass. A six-axis force-torque sensor senses weight shift},

The array will receive frequencies in a band from around 30 kHz to 30 MHz.

  abstract = {Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are typically solved by finding an approximate global solution to a corresponding belief-MDP. In this paper, we offer a new planning algorithm for POMDPs with continuous state, action and observation spaces. Since such domains have an inherent notion of locality, we can find an approximate solution using local optimization methods. We parameterize the belief distribution as a Gaussian mixture, and use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to approximate the belief update. Since the EKF is a first-order filter, we can marginalize over the observations analytically. By using feedback control and state estimation during policy execution, we recover a behavior that is effectively conditioned on incoming observations despite the unconditioned planning. Local optimization provides no guarantees of global optimality, but it allows us to tackle domains that are at least an order of magnitude larger than the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a simulated hand-eye coordination domain with 16 continuous state dimensions and 6 continuous action dimensions.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of efficiently computing higherorder variational integrators in simulation and trajectory optimization of mechanical systems as those often found in robotic applications. We develop O(n) algorithms to evaluate the discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations and compute the Newton direction for solving the DEL equations, which results in linear-time variational integrators of arbitrarily high order. To our knowledge, no linear-time higher-order variational or even implicit integrators have been developed before. Moreover, an O(n2) algorithm to linearize the DEL equations is presented, which is useful for trajectory optimization. These proposed algorithms eliminate the bottleneck of implementing higher-order variational integrators in simulation and trajectory optimization of complex robotic systems. The efficacy of this paper is validated through comparison with existing methods, and implementation on various robotic systems---including trajectory optimization of the Spring Flamingo robot, the LittleDog robot and the Atlas robot. The results illustrate that the same integrator can be used for simulation and trajectory optimization in robotics, preserving mechanical properties while achieving good scalability and accuracy.},

The algorithm is based on a linear quadratic approximation of an exponential risk sensitive nonlinear control problem. ILEG allows to find risk sensitive policies and thus generalizes previous algorithms to solve nonlinear optimal control based on iterative linear-quadratic methods. Depending on the setting of the parameter controlling the risk sensitivity, two different strategies on how to cope with the risk emerge. For positive-value parameters, the control policy uses high feedback gains whereas for negative-value parameters, it uses a robust feedforward control strategy (a robust plan) with low gains. These results are illustrated with a simple example. This note should be considered as a preliminary report.},

Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful model-based optimization technique that enables the control of such nonlinear systems with constraints. However, modern systems often lack computationally tractable models, motivating the use of system identification techniques to learn accurate and efficient models for real-time control. In this tutorial article, we review emerging data-driven methods for model discovery and how they are used for nonlinear MPC. In particular, we focus on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and show how it may be used with MPC on an infectious disease control example. We compare the performance against MPC based on a linear dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) model. Code is provided to run the tutorial examples and may be modified to extend this data-driven control framework to arbitrary nonlinear systems.},

Analytical rigid-body contact models are used extensively in planning and control due to their computational efficiency and simplicity, yet despite their prevalence, little if any empirical comparison of these models has been made and it is unclear how well they approximate contact outcomes. In this paper, we first formulate a system identification approach for six commonly used contact models in the literature, and use the proposed method to find parameters for an experimental data-set of impacts. Next, we compare the models empirically, and establish a task specific upper bound on the performance of the models and the rigid-body contact model paradigm. We highlight the limitations of these models, salient failure modes, and the care that should be taken in parameter selection, which are ultimately difficult to give a physical interpretation.},

The efficiency is achieved by the use of recursive formulations of the equations of motion, i.e. formulations in which the equations of motion are expressed implicitly in terms of recurrence relations between the quantities describing the system. The use of recursive formulations in dynamics is fairly new, 50 the principles of their operation and reasons for their efficiency are explained. Three main algorithms are described: the recursIve Newton-Euler formulation for inverse dynamics (the calculation of the forces given the accelerations), and the composite-rigid-body and articulated-body methods for forward dynamics (the calculation of the accelerations given the forces). These algorithms are initially described in terms of an un-branched, open\- loop kinematic chain -- a typical serial robot mechanism. This is done to keep the descriptions of the algorithms simple, and is in line with descriptions appearing in the literature. Once the basic algorithms have been introduced, the restrictions on the mechanism are lifted and the algorithms are extended to cope with kinematic trees and loops, and general constraints at the joints. The problem of simulating the effect of contact between a robot and its environment is also considered. Some consideration is given to the details and practical problems of implementing these algori?hms on a computer.},

Our approach was initially targeted at walking, and it consisted of two levels of optimization: a high-level trajectory optimizer that reasons about center of mass and swing foot trajectories, and a low-level controller that tracks those trajectories by solving floating base full body inverse dynamics using quadratic programming. This controller is capable of walking on rough terrain, and it also achieves long footsteps, fast walking speeds, and heel-strike and toe-off in simulation. During development of these and other whole body tasks on the physical robot, we introduced an additional optimization component in the low-level controller, namely an inverse kinematics controller. Modeling and torque measurement errors and hardware features of the Atlas robot led us to this three-part approach, which was applied to three tasks in the DRC Trials in December 2013.},

This strategy exploits solution information of the previous QP under the assumption that the active set does not change much from one QP to the next. Furthermore, we present a modification where the CPU time is limited in order to make it suitable for strict real-time applications. Its performance is demonstrated with a challenging test example comprising 240 variables and 1191 inequalities, which depends on 57 parameters and is prohibitive for explicit MPC approaches. In this example, our strategy allows CPU times of well below 100ms per QP and was about one order of magnitude faster than a standard active set QP solver},

  abstract = {Google's Cloud TPUs are a promising new hardware architecture for machine learning workloads. They have powered many of Google's milestone machine learning achievements in recent years. Google has now made TPUs available for general use on their cloud platform and as of very recently has opened them up further to allow use by non-TensorFlow frontends. We describe a method and implementation for offloading suitable sections of Julia programs to TPUs via this new API and the Google XLA compiler. Our method is able to completely fuse the forward pass of a VGG19 model expressed as a Julia program and into a single TPU exectuable to be offloaded to the device. Our method composes well with existing compiler-based automatic differentiation techniques on Julia code, and we are thus able to also automatically obtain the VGG19 backwards pass and similarly offload it to the TPU. Targeting TPUs using our compiler, we are able to evaluate the VGG19 forward pass on a batch of 100 images in 0.23s which compares favorably to the 52.4s required for the original model on the CPU. Our implementation is less than 1000 lines of Julia, with no TPU specfic changes made to the core Julia compiler or any other Julia packages.},

Animals are capable of manipulating flow around the body and appendages both passively and actively. Passive mechanisms rely on structural and morphological components of the body (i.e., humpback whale tubercles, riblets). Active flow control mechanisms use appendage or body musculature to directly generate wake flow structures or stiffen fins against external hydrodynamic loads. Fish can actively control fin curvature, displacement, and area. The vortex wake shed by the tail differs between eel-like fishes and fishes with a discrete narrowing of the body in front of the tail, and three-dimensional effects may play a major role in determining wake structure in most fishes.}

  abstract = {Executing agile quadrotor maneuvers with cablesuspended payloads is a challenging problem and complications induced by the dynamics typically require trajectory optimization. State-of-the-art approaches often need significant computation time and complex parameter tuning. We present a novel dynamical model and a fast trajectory optimization algorithm for quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload. Our first contribution is a new formulation of the suspended payload behavior, modeled as a link attached to the quadrotor with a combination of two revolute joints and a prismatic joint, all being passive. Differently from state of the art, we do not require the use of hybrid modes depending on the cable tension. Our second contribution is a fast trajectory optimization technique for the aforementioned system. Our model enables us to pose the trajectory optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Desired behaviors of the system (e.g., obstacle avoidance) can easily be formulated within this framework. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of computation speed and guarantees feasibility of the trajectory with respect to both the system dynamics and control input saturation, while utilizing far fewer tuning parameters. We experimentally validate our approach on a real quadrotor showing that our method generalizes to a variety of tasks, such as flying through desired waypoints while avoiding obstacles, or throwing the payload toward a desired target. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that three-dimensional, agile maneuvers exploiting the system dynamics have been achieved on quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload.},

However, a kilometer-scale rotating space structure is needed to generate artificial gravity at rotation rates that can be tolerated comfortably by crew. Constructing such a structure with current technology would require many launches and significant in-space assembly. This work presents HERDS, High-Expansion-Ratio Deployable Structures, a hierarchical expansion mechanism that can deploy a kilometer-scale structure from a single launch. HERDS leverages a hierarchical combination of a Kresling mechanism and a pop-up extending truss (PET), a novel variant of the scissor mechanism. We show that HERDS designs achieve 4-11x better beam member aspect ratios than non-hierarchical Kresling or scissor mechanisms, resulting in a stiffer deployed structure. Furthermore, HERDS designs are shown in simulation to satisfy the necessary loading and structural constraints for supporting the Lunar Gateway mission with a factor of safety greater than 1.5 using existing launch vehicles. Our modeling and analysis is validated on a 1/10 scale prototype with a 50x expansion ratio.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel episodic method to learn a robot's nonlinear dynamics model and an increasingly optimal control sequence for a set of tasks. The method is based on the Koopman operator approach to nonlinear dynamical systems analysis, which models the flow of observables in a function space, rather than a flow in a state space. Practically, this method estimates a nonlinear diffeomorphism that lifts the dynamics to a higher dimensional space where they are linear. Efficient Model Predictive Control methods can then be applied to the lifted model. This approach allows for real time implementation in on-board hardware, with rigorous incorporation of both input and state constraints during learning. We demonstrate the method in a real-time implementation of fast multirotor landing, where the nonlinear ground effect is learned and used to improve landing speed and quality.}

Koopman-based model learning methods can capture these nonlinear dynamical system effects in higher dimensional lifted bilinear models that are amenable to optimal control. However, standard methods that lift the system state using a fixed function dictionary before model learning result in high dimensional models that are intractable for real time control. This paper presents a novel method that jointly learns a function dictionary and lifted bilinear model purely from data by incorporating the Koopman model in a neural network architecture. Nonlinear MPC design utilizing the learned model can be performed readily. We experimentally realized this method on a multirotor drone for agile trajectory tracking at low altitudes where the aerodynamic ground effect influences the system's behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the learning-based controller achieves similar performance as a nonlinear MPC based on a nominal dynamics model in medium altitude. However, our learning-based system can reliably track trajectories in near-ground flight regimes while the nominal controller crashes due to unmodeled dynamical effects that are captured by our method.},

The mission has been jointly developed by the National Space Organization of Taiwan and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research of the U.S. in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA, and the Naval Research Laboratory for three onboard payloads, including a GPS Occultation Receiver, a triband beacon, and a tiny ionospheric photometer. The FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission was successfully launched from Vandenberg into the same orbit plane of the designated 516-km circular parking orbit altitude on April 15, 2006. After the six satellites completed the in-orbit checkout activities, the mission was started immediately at the parking orbit for in-orbit checkout, calibration, and experiment of three onboard payloads. Individual spacecraft thrust burns for orbit raising were performed to begin the constellation deployment of the satellites into six separate orbit planes. All six FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellites are maintained in a good state of health except spacecraft flight model no. 2, which has had power shortages. Five out of the six satellites had reached their final mission orbits of 800 km as of November 2007. This paper provides an overview of the constellation spacecraft design, constellation mission operations, constellation deployment timeline evolution, associated spacecraft mass property and moment of inertia results, orbit-raising challenges, and lessons learned during the orbit-raising operations.},

  abstract = {Interior methods are an omnipresent, conspicuous feature of the constrained optimization landscape today, but it was not always so. Primarily in the form of barrier methods, interior-point techniques were popular during the 1960s for solving nonlinearly constrained problems. However, their use for linear programming was not even contemplated because of the total dominance of the simplex method. Vague but continuing anxiety about barrier methods eventually led to their abandonment in favor of newly emerging, apparently more efficient alternatives such as augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods. By the early 1980s, barrier methods were almost without exception regarded as a closed chapter in the history of optimization.  This picture changed dramatically with Karmarkar's widely publicized announcement in 1984 of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming; in 1985, a formal connection was established between his method and classical barrier methods. Since then, interior methods have advanced so far, so fast, that their influence has transformed both the theory and practice of constrained optimization. This article provides a condensed, selective look at classical material and recent research about interior methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization.},

  abstract = {Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90\%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the "lottery ticket hypothesis:" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20\% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

Recent work has applied similar methodology in the setting of multiplayer general-sum differential games. Here, ILQ methods are capable of finding local Nash equilibria in interactive motion planning problems in real-time. As in most iterative procedures, however, this approach can be sensitive to initial conditions and hyperparameter choices, which can result in poor computational performance or even unsafe trajectories. In this paper, we focus our attention on a broad class of dynamical systems which are feedback linearizable, and exploit this structure to improve both algorithmic reliability and runtime. We showcase our new algorithm in three distinct traffic scenarios, and observe that in practice our method converges significantly more often and more quickly than was possible without exploiting the feedback linearizable structure.},

Unfortunately, numerical solution techniques for general nonlinear dynamical systems scale poorly with state dimension and are rarely used in applications requiring real-time computation. For single-agent optimal control problems, however, local methods based on iteratively solving approximations with linear dynamics and quadratic costs have become increasingly popular. We take inspiration from one such method, the iterative linear quadratic regulator (ILQR), and observe that a similar linear-quadratic approximation can also be solved efficiently for multi-player games. Whereas ILQR converges to a local solution of the optimal control problem, if our method converges it returns a local Nash equilibrium of the differential game. We demonstrate our method in a two-player zero-sum example as well as a three-player general-sum case.},

Because the system is fully compatible with Autograd, it allows forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation of Python functions to arbitrary order. Because JAX supports structured control flow, it can generate code for sophisticated machine learning algorithms while maintaining high performance. We show that by combining JAX with Autograd and Numpy we get an easily programmable and highly performant ML system that targets CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, capable of scaling to multi-core Cloud TPUs.},

Learning an industrial insertion policy in real is challenging as the collision between the parts and the environment can cause slippage or breakage of the part. In this paper, we present a safe self-supervised method to learn a visuo-tactile insertion policy that is robust to grasp pose variations. The method reduces human input and collisions between the part and the receptacle. The method divides the insertion task into two phases. In the first align phase, a tactile-based grasp pose estimation model is learned to align the insertion part with the receptacle. In the second insert phase, a vision-based policy is learned to guide the part into the receptacle. The robot uses force-torque sensing to achieve a safe self-supervised data collection pipeline. Physical experiments on the USB insertion task from the NIST Assembly Taskboard suggest that the resulting policies can achieve 45/45 insertion successes on 45 different initial grasp poses, improving on two baselines: (1) a behavior cloning agent trained on 50 human insertion demonstrations (1/45) and (2) an online RL policy (TD3) trained in real (0/45).},

The immersed interface method is re-interpreted as a polynomial extrapolation of flow quantities and boundary conditions into the immersed solid bodies, reducing computational cost and enabling simulations with nonconvex bodies that could not be discretized with previous immersed interface methods. In the flow, the vorticity transport equation is discretized using a conservative finite difference scheme and explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The velocity reconstruction problem is transformed to a scalar Poisson equation that is discretized with conservative finite differences, and solved using an FFT-accelerated iterative algorithm. The use of conservative differencing throughout leads to exact enforcement of a discrete Kelvin's theorem, allowing for simulations with multiply connected domains and outflow boundaries that have challenged other immersed interface vortex methods. We also explore novel methods for recovering time-dependent pressure distributions on immersed bodies within a vorticity-based method and present a novel control volume formulation for recovering aerodynamic moments from only the vorticity and velocity fields. The method achieves second order spatial accuracy and third order temporal accuracy, and is validated on a variety of 2D flows in internal and free-space domains.},

Each AeroCube was also equipped with two extendable wings that altered the satellite's cross-sectional area by a factor of three. In conjunction with the GPS measurements, high-precision orbit determination detected deliberate changes in the AeroCube's drag profile via wing manipulation. The AeroCube operations team succeeded in using this variable drag to re-order the satellites' in-track configuration. A differential cross-section was created by closing the wings of one satellite while the others' remained open, and the relative in-track motion between two AeroCubes was reversed. Over the course of several weeks, the satellites' in-track configuration was re-ordered, demonstrating the feasibility of CubeSat formation flight via differential drag.},

Given a known orbit and desired attitude state, the method utilizes a nonlinear dynamics model and a fast constrained trajectory optimization solver based on differential dynamic programming to arrive at a nominal torque profile that respects the spacecraft's actuator limitations. This nominal maneuver is then tracked using a time-varying linear-quadratic regulator (LQR). To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control technique, closed-loop Monte-Carlo simulations are performed from a variety of orbits and initial conditions. Our method is shown to significantly outperform previous magnetorquer-only control schemes by offering convergence from large initial errors and fast slew rates that exploit the full performance capabilities of the actuators. Computational complexity of the method and future implementation in flight software onboard a CubeSat are also discussed.},

An analysis is given that shows which of the many variations of the method fits best to legged robots. Two different methods to solve the discretized normal cone inclusions are compared: the projected over-relaxed Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration. The methods are evaluated for an electrically-driven quadrupedal robot in terms of robustness, accuracy, speed and ease of use. Furthermore, the dependence of the simulation speed on the choice of the generalized coordinates is examined. The proposed technique is implemented in C++ and compared to a fast and simple approach based on compliant contact models. In conclusion, the introduced method with hard contacts is very beneficial for the simulation of legged robots.},

Through a principled mollification of normal and tangential contact forces, our method circumvents the main difficulties inherent to the non-smooth nature of frictional contact. We combine this new contact model with fully-implicit time integration to obtain a robust and efficient dynamics solver that is analytically differentiable. In conjunction with adjoint sensitivity analysis, our formulation enables gradient-based optimization with adaptive trade-offs between simulation accuracy and smoothness of objective function landscapes. We thoroughly analyse our approach on a set of simulation examples involving rigid bodies, visco-elastic materials, and coupled multi-body systems. We furthermore showcase applications of our differentiable simulator to parameter estimation for deformable objects, motion planning for robotic manipulation, trajectory optimization for compliant walking robots, as well as efficient self-supervised learning of control policies.},

We have also jointly determined spherical harmonic solutions for the static and time-variable gravity field of Mars, and the Mars k2 Love numbers, exclusive of the gravity contribution of the atmosphere. Consequently, the retrieved time-varying gravity coefficients and the Love number k2 solely yield seasonal variations in the mass of the polar caps and the solid tides of Mars, respectively. We obtain a Mars Love number k2 of 0.1697 {\textpm} 0.0027 (3-{$\sigma$}). The inclusion of MRO tracking data results in improved seasonal gravity field coefficients C30 and, for the first time, C50. Refinements of the atmospheric model in our orbit determination program have allowed us to monitor the odd zonal harmonic C30 for {$\sim$}1.5 solar cycles (16 years).

  abstract = {The cross-track baseline requirement in a satellite formation flying mission requires an orbital plane-change maneuver during the acquisition phase. While the optimization of orbital plane-change maneuver has been well studied, the constraints of the propulsion system, such as the power limitation, battery charging cycle, and finite thrust durations, are often neglected. In addition, the self-pressurized chemical propulsion system used in this satellite mission experiences a performance degradation effect over prolonged use in terms of specific impulse and thrust force. To overcome these constraints on the orbital plane-change maneuver process, this article proposes an optimized algorithm by minimizing Edelbaum's equation using a selective constrained ensemble Kalman filter that includes propulsion's performance variation and firing duration constraints. Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted to benchmark the proposed method against the theoretical impulsive thrusts in terms of \${\textbackslash}Delta V\$ , and the commonly adopted natural precession-based plane-change method in terms of the total time taken. Results from the simulation have shown that the required \${\textbackslash}Delta V\$ of this proposed method is similar to the theoretical impulsive burn method. In addition, it requires a 75\% shorter time than the natural precession method in achieving the desired plane change and is 36\% more fuel efficient than the direct firing method. Furthermore, this study has verified that this algorithm can be directly integrated with the existing formation control algorithm.},

These methods have become particularly important in the field of variational image processing, which frequently requires the minimization of non-differentiable objectives. This paper considers accelerated (i.e., fast) variants of two common alternating direction methods: the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and the Alternating Minimization Algorithm (AMA). The proposed acceleration is of the form first proposed by Nesterov for gradient descent methods. In the case that the objective function is strongly convex, global convergence bounds are provided for both classical and accelerated variants of the methods. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the fast methods for a wide variety of problems.},

In the first step, the attitude dynamics of the rigid body are represented by modified Rodriguez parameters (MRP). In the second step, a Lyapunov- based controller synthesis is performed based on the Sum of Squares (SOS) technique. The key observation that makes rigid body control amenable to an efficient (convex) design technique such as SOS is that both quaternions and modified Rodriguez parameters enable the representation of the attitude dynamics of a rigid body by polynomial vector fields. The model proposed in this paper will use MRP instead of quaternions to represent the rigid body attitude to yield a minimal parameterization. The effectiveness of the proposed control technique is shown in simulations for a large angle maneuver corresponding to a satellite rotation about a fixed axis.},

The expanded role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has provided an ideal platform for exploring these emergent morphing concepts since at this scale a greater amount of risk can be taken, as well as having more manageable fabrication and cost requirements. This review focuses on presenting the role UAVs have in morphing research by giving an overview of the UAV morphing concepts, designs, and technologies described in the literature. A presentation of quantitative information as well as a discussion of technical issues is given where possible to begin gaining some insight into the overall assessment and performance of these technologies.},

  abstract = {Inaccurate estimates of the thermospheric density are a major source of error in low Earth orbit prediction. Therefore, real-time density estimation is required to improve orbit prediction. In this work, we develop a dynamic reduced-order model for the thermospheric density that enables real-time density estimation using two-line element (TLE) data. For this, the global thermospheric density is represented by the main spatial modes of the atmosphere and a time-varying low-dimensional state and a linear model is derived for the dynamics. Three different models are developed based on density data from the TIE-GCM, NRLMSISE-00, and JB2008 thermosphere models and are valid from 100 to maximum 800 km altitude. Using the models and TLE data, the global density is estimated by simultaneously estimating the density and the orbits and ballistic coefficients of several objects using a Kalman filter. The sequential estimation provides both estimates of the density and corresponding uncertainty. Accurate density estimation using the TLEs of 17 objects is demonstrated and validated against CHAMP and GRACE accelerometer-derived densities. The estimated densities are shown to be significantly more accurate and less biased than NRLMSISE-00 and JB2008 modeled densities. The uncertainty in the density estimates is quantified and shown to be dependent on the geographical location, solar activity, and objects used for estimation. In addition, the data assimilation capability of the model is highlighted by assimilating CHAMP accelerometer-derived density data together with TLE data to obtain more accurate global density estimates. Finally, the dynamic thermosphere model is used to forecast the density.},

This problem is commonly circumvented by using a fast tracking controller to compensate for model errors between updates. In this work, we show that the feedback policy from a Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) based MPC algorithm is a viable alternative to bridge the gap between the low MPC update rate and the actuation command rate. We propose to augment the DDP approach with a relaxed barrier function to address inequality constraints arising from the friction cone. A frequency-dependent cost function is used to reduce the sensitivity to high-frequency model errors and actuator bandwidth limits. We demonstrate that our approach can find stable locomotion policies for the torque-controlled quadruped, ANYmal, both in simulation and on hardware.},

In this paper we present the first real-time realization of a unified NMPC and CLF controller on a robotic system with limited computational resources. These limitations motivate a set of approaches for efficiently incorporating CLF stability constraints into a general NMPC formulation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared to baseline CLF and NMPC controllers with a robotic Segway platform both in simulation and on hardware. The addition of a prediction horizon provides a performance advantage over CLF based controllers, which operate optimally point-wise in time. Moreover, the explicitly imposed stability constraints remove the need for difficult cost function and parameter tuning required by NMPC. Therefore the unified controller improves the performance of each isolated controller and simplifies the overall design process.},

The development of performant controllers and motion plans for these systems commonly requires time-consuming iterations on hardware. We present the SoMo (Soft Motion) toolkit, a software framework that makes it easy to instantiate and control typical continuum manipulators in an accurate physics simulator. SoMo introduces a standardized and human-readable description format for continuum manipulators. It leverages this description format and the Bullet physics engine to enable fast and accurate simulations of soft and soft-rigid hybrid robots in environments with complex contact interactions. This allows users to vary design and control parameters across simulations with minimal effort. We compare the capabilities of SoMo to other physics simulators and highlight the benefits and accuracy of SoMo by demonstrating the agreement between simulation and real-world experiments on several examples; these include an in-hand manipulation task with continuum fingers, an automated exploration of how to design soft fingers for precision grasping, and a brief snake locomotion study. Overall, SoMo provides an accessible way for designers of soft robotic hardware and control systems to gain access to a simulation-accelerated workflow.},

  abstract = {It is well known that certain aquatic vertebrates (notably dolphins and some of the larger teleostean fishes) are able to travel at surprisingly high speeds. The movements performed by such animals during rectilinear locomotion are all of the same type, for the hind end of the body vibrates rhythmically in a plane at right-angles to the axis of locomotion; the plane of vibration of the dolphin is dorso-ventral, whereas that of a fish is transverse to the long axis of the body. In all cases the orientation of the hind end of the body and of the caudal fin, in particular, is such that during both phases of each vibration the leading surface (relative to the direction of the vibration) is inclined at an angle to its own direction of motion through the water and is directed obliquely backwards relative to the head of the animal (Gray, 1933). The anatomical arrangements of the propulsive muscles of a dolphin appear to be simpler than those of a fish, since the locomotory movements are produced by four bands of musculature connected to the base of the caudal fin by strong tendons ; on the ventral side of the vertebral column the two muscle bands extend forward to the region of the diaphragm, whereas the two dorsal bands extend over the whole back of the animal. The weight of the dorsal musculature is approximately twice that of the ventral muscles. The tail is deflected upwards by the contraction of the dorsal muscles and downwards by contraction of the ventral muscles. Reciprocity thus exists between the dorsal and ventral muscle groups, whereas, in a fish, reciprocity of this type is restricted to the right and left musculature of individual segments. Apart from these anatomical differences the propulsive mechanisms of a fish and of a dolphin appear to be of essentially the same type.}

In this article we present the deformation space formulation for soft robots dynamics, developed using a finite element approach. Starting from the Cosserat rod theory formulated on a Lie group, we derive a discrete model using a helicoidal shape function for the spatial discretization and a geometric scheme for the time integration of the robot shape configuration. The main motivation behind this work is the derivation of accurate and computational efficient models for soft robots. The model takes into account bending, torsion, shear, and axial deformations due to general external loading conditions. It is validated through analytic and experimental benchmark. The results demonstrate that the model matches experimental positions with errors {$<$}1\% of the robot length. The computer implementation of the model results in SimSOFT, a dynamic simulation environment for design, analysis, and control of soft robots.},

Previously such models required complex continuum mechanics formulations and correspondingly complex algorithms. We show that a simple shell model can be derived geometrically for triangle meshes and implemented quickly by modifying a standard cloth simulator. Our technique convincingly simulates a variety of curved objects with materials ranging from paper to metal, as we demonstrate with several examples including a comparison of a real and simulated falling hat.},

Their aptitude to achieve the required performance was confirmed by multiple numerical simulations under different initial conditions and various scenarios. The new algorithms were tested onboard the Israeli Gurwin-TechSAT micro-satellite, nominally momentum-biased, stabilized within 2--2.5{\textopenbullet} precision by the proportion-plus-derivative magnetic controller. In the flight tests of the new controllers, some valuable results were obtained, such as revealing the possibility to effectively maintain the satellite 3-axis stabilization even with a very small momentum bias, and the implementation and efficient performance of the properly modified extended and linear Kalman filters in the onboard computer.},

We introduce Structured Mechanical Models, a flexible model class for mechanical systems that are data-efficient, easily amenable to prior knowledge, and easily usable with model-based control techniques. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the benefits of using Structured Mechanical Models in lieu of black-box neural networks when modeling robot dynamics. We demonstrate that they generalize better from limited data and yield more reliable model-based controllers on a variety of simulated robotic domains.},

  abstract = {Soft robots promise improved safety and capability over rigid robots when deployed near humans or in complex, delicate, and dynamic environments. However, infinite degrees of freedom and the potential for highly nonlinear dynamics severely complicate their modeling and control. Analytical and machine learning methodologies have been applied to model soft robots but with constraints: quasi-static motions, quasi-linear deflections, or both. Here, we advance the modeling and control of soft robots into the inertial, nonlinear regime. We controlled motions of a soft, continuum arm with velocities 10 times larger and accelerations 40 times larger than those of previous work and did so for high-deflection shapes with more than 110{$^\circ$} of curvature. We leveraged a data-driven learning approach for modeling, based on Koopman operator theory, and we introduce the concept of the static Koopman operator as a pregain term in optimal control. Our approach is rapid, requiring less than 5 min of training; is computationally low cost, requiring as little as 0.5 s to build the model; and is design agnostic, learning and accurately controlling two morphologically different soft robots. This work advances rapid modeling and control for soft robots from the realm of quasi-static to inertial, laying the groundwork for the next generation of compliant and highly dynamic robots. Data-driven modeling and control of soft robot arms enable previously inaccessible results in inertial and nonlinear regimes.}

While quasi-static models have traditionally been unable to capture grasping and jamming behaviors, our approach solves this issue by explicitly modeling the limiting behavior of a velocity-controlled manipulator. We retain the precise modeling of surface contact pressure distributions and efficient computation of contact-rich behaviors of previous methods and additionally prove existence of solutions for any desired manipulator motion. We derive continuous and time-stepping formulations, both posed as tractable Linear Complementarity Problems (LCPs).},

  abstract = {Modern deep neural networks have a large number of parameters, making them very hard to train. We propose DSD, a dense-sparse-dense training flow, for regularizing deep neural networks and achieving better optimization performance. In the first D (Dense) step, we train a dense network to learn connection weights and importance. In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and retraining the network given the sparsity constraint. In the final D (re-Dense) step, we increase the model capacity by removing the sparsity constraint, re-initialize the pruned parameters from zero and retrain the whole dense network. Experiments show that DSD training can improve the performance for a wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification, caption generation and speech recognition. On ImageNet, DSD improved the Top1 accuracy of GoogLeNet by 1.1\%, VGG-16 by 4.3\%, ResNet-18 by 1.2\% and ResNet-50 by 1.1\%, respectively. On the WSJ'93 dataset, DSD improved DeepSpeech and DeepSpeech2 WER by 2.0\% and 1.1\%. On the Flickr-8K dataset, DSD improved the NeuralTalk BLEU score by over 1.7. DSD is easy to use in practice: at training time, DSD incurs only one extra hyper-parameter: the sparsity ratio in the S step. At testing time, DSD doesn't change the network architecture or incur any inference overhead. The consistent and significant performance gain of DSD experiments shows the inadequacy of the current training methods for finding the best local optimum, while DSD effectively achieves superior optimization performance for finding a better solution. DSD models are available to download at https://songhan.github.io/DSD.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to solve the minimum time rendezvous problem of multiple spacecraft using differential drag. The problem is to rendezvous any number of vehicles using only the relative aerodynamic drag between the vehicles. Each vehicle is equipped with drag plates that can be opened or closed, thus modulating the drag force acting on the vehicle. By actuating the drag plates, the aerodynamic drag becomes the control used to accomplish the rendezvous. The optimal control problem is relaxed to a convex problem, and it is proved that a solution of the relaxed problem exists that is also a solution of the original problem. This process is called lossless convexification, and it leads to a solution method based on solving a finite number of linear programming problems. This method offers guaranteed convergence to the global minimum in polynomial time and does not require an initial guess. Two examples are solved with two and five vehicles and the results are compared with existing technologies. Because the method is fast and globally convergent, it is well suited for real-time use onboard a vehicle.},

Many payloads require precision ADCS to achieve the desired performance; however, such precision is typically cost-prohibitive for small spacecraft. To address this problem, Blue Canyon Technologies (BCT) has developed FlexCore, which is a highly-configurable ADCS that uses a core electronics box (based on the XACT cubesat ADCS), combined with any of the various reaction wheel sizes in the BCT product line. The FlexCore electronics and software stays the same, regardless of the spacecraft. The wide range of reaction wheel and torque rod sizes supports spacecraft sizes from large CubeSats to 100s of kilograms. The stellar-based attitude determination and control provides accuracy of 0.002-deg, RMS. Features of FlexCore include: multiple nano star trackers with integrated stray-light baffles; 3 or 4 low-jitter reaction wheels; 3 torque rods; GPS receiver; MEMS IMU; MEMS magnetometer; sun sensors; integrated processor and electronics; auto-generated flight software, including star identification, Kalman filter, momentum control, thruster control, and orbit propagation. The table-driven, auto-coded software is easily configured to support any mission, and is delivered to the user fully programmed.},

  abstract = {Entry flight is a critical mission phase of planetary aeroassist problems. During atmospheric flight, aleatory-epistemic uncertainty and environmental factors reduce the accuracy of predicted future states for precision targeting. This problem has been approached historically with closed-loop guidance rooted in certainty equivalence. This property separates estimation and control problems, allowing each to be considered independently. In other concept studies, an observer model is neglected altogether in favor of assuming perfect state knowledge. However, a flight system will inevitably have imprecise state information and variability in its underlying dynamics and measurement models. Systemic uncertainty is a fundamental limitation of existing entry guidance approaches. This work seeks to overcome these challenges by posing aerocapture as a robust optimization problem. The cost objective of the maneuver is reformulated to account for uncertainty in atmospheric structure, vehicle performance parameters, and state estimation accuracy using an observer-based consider filter. An expected value performance cost is developed from anticipated measurement conditioning effects. A rapid solution methodology is illustrated using explicit integration strategies with a parameterized control structure. Results for a Mars aerocapture concept study show improvement in the postcapture orbit accuracy with low computational overhead.},

The research community is however handicapped by the lack of a flexible, easily deployable platform for prototyping IoT endpoints that would allow for ground up protocol development and investigation of how such protocols perform at scale. We introduce tinySDR, the first software-defined radio platform tailored to the needs of power-constrained IoT endpoints. TinySDR provides a standalone, fully programmable low power software-defined radio solution that can be duty cycled for battery operation like a real IoT endpoint, and more importantly, can be programmed over the air to allow for large scale deployment. We present extensive evaluation of our platform showing it consumes as little as 30 uW of power in sleep mode, which is 10,000x lower than existing SDR platforms. We present two case studies by implementing LoRa and BLE beacons on the platform and achieve sensitivities of -126 dBm and -94 dBm respectively while consuming 11\% and 3\% of the FPGA resources. Finally, using tinySDR, we explore the research question of whether an IoT device can demodulate concurrent LoRa transmissions in real-time, within its power and computing constraints.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

The first one is characterized by a Jacobian that possesses eigenvalues with large negative real parts. Parabolic partial differential equations and their spatial discretization are typical examples. The second class consists of highly oscillatory problems with purely imaginary eigenvalues of large modulus. Apart from motivating the construction of exponential integrators for various classes of problems, our main intention in this article is to present the mathematics behind these methods. We will derive error bounds that are independent of stiffness or highest frequencies in the system.             Since the implementation of exponential integrators requires the evaluation of the product of a matrix function with a vector, we will briefly discuss some possible approaches as well. The paper concludes with some applications, in which exponential integrators are used.},

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm called Deep Value Model Predictive Control (DMPC), which combines model-based trajectory optimization with value function estimation. The DMPC actor is a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimizer with an objective function defined in terms of a value function estimated by the critic. We show that our MPC actor is an importance sampler, which minimizes an upper bound of the cross-entropy to the state distribution of the optimal sampling policy. In our experiments with a Ballbot system, we show that our algorithm can work with sparse and binary reward signals to efficiently solve obstacle avoidance and target reaching tasks. Compared to previous work, we show that including the value function in the running cost of the trajectory optimizer speeds up the convergence. We also discuss the necessary strategies to robustify the algorithm in practice.},

For aerospace applications demanding increasingly more distributed processing and sensing capability, the compounding risk to system reliability as device count scales becomes a limiting factor in mission scope, performance, and lifetime. We propose a simple external circuit to be added to each node on a communication bus that automatically isolates the node in the event of device failure. By automatically isolating failed devices, the integrity of the bus is preserved without requiring additional signals or processing overhead from the host controller. In this article, I\textsuperscript{2}C and SPI isolation circuits are simulated, fabricated, and experimentally verified to be effective at preserving bus integrity in the event of peripheral device failure. The isolation circuits were integrated into three spacecraft for the successful NASA V-R3x mission and found to significantly improve system reliability by eliminating single-point failure modes of the I\textsuperscript{2}C and SPI buses. The developed protection schemes are a valuable tool for decoupling system reliability from serial bus device count and can readily be integrated into existing aerospace systems.},

  abstract = {Over the past several decades, as affordable computational power has increased, simulation has become increasingly important in robot analysis, planning, and control. Smooth robot dynamics can be simulated efficiently and accurately, and therefore, readily used in model-based control schemes. However, some of the most difficult and important problems in robotics, such as running, grasping, and parts assembly, involve intermittent frictional contacts, which introduce extreme nonlinearities into the dynamics. Numerous approaches have been developed to simulate contact dynamics. Even though real bodies are not rigid, idealized rigid contact models have been used widely and productively for decades. However, the resulting nonsmooth dynamics can be computationally difficult to solve or use in model-based planning and control, motivating researchers to propose various relaxations of the idealized contact models. The varied origins and formulations of these approaches can obscure their similarities and differences. In this letter, we identify and explain differences between four contact models. We present the models in the context of one solver that is applicable to all of them, namely Projected Gauss-Seidel, in order to highlight their common structure and to avoid confounding their comparison with differences in the solution methods. Simulation results from sliding, wedging, grasping, and stacking experiments illustrate consequences of the differences. The results can help inform roboticists when comparing and selecting models for their specific applications.},

  abstract = {QFT is an engineering design theory devoted to the practical design of feedback control systems. The foundation of QFT is that feedback is needed in control only when plant (P), parameter and/or disturbance (D) uncertainties (sets {$P$}=P, {$D$}=D) exceed the acceptable (A) system performance uncertainty (set {$A$}=A). The principal properties of QFT are as follows. (1) The amount of feedback needed is tuned to the ({$P$}, {$D$}, {$A$}) sets. If {$A$} `exceeds' ({$P$}, {$D$}), feedback is not needed at all. (2) The simplest modelling is used: (a) command, disturbance and sensor noise inputs, and (b) the available sensing points and the defined outputs. No special controllability test is needed in either linear or non-linear plants. It is inherent in the design procedure. There is no observability problem because uncertainty is included. The number of independent sensors determines the number of independent loop transmissions (Li), the functions which provide the benefits of feedback. (3) The simplest mathematical tools have been found most use ful---primarily frequency response. The uncertainties are expressed as sets in the complex plane. The need for the larger {$P$}, {$D$} sets to be squeezed into the smaller {$A$} set results in bounds on the Li(j{$\omega$}) in the complex plane. In the more complex systems a key problem is the division of the `feedback burden' among the available Li(j{$\omega$}). Point-by-point frequency synthesis tremendously simplifies this problem. This is also true for highly uncertain non-linear and time-varying plants which are converted into rigorously equivalent linear time invariant plant sets and/or disturbance sets with respect to the acceptable output set {$A$}. Fixed point theory justifies the equivalence. (4) Design trade-offs are highly transparent in the frequency domain: between design complexity and cost of feedback (primarily bandwidth), sensor noise levels, plant saturation levels, number of sensors needed, relative sizes of {$P$}, {$A$} and cost of feedback. The designer sees the trade-offs between these factors as he proceeds and can decide according to their relative importance in his particular situation. QFT design techniques with these properties have been developed step by step for: (i) highly uncertain linear time invariant (LTI) SISO single- and multiple-loop systems, MIMO single-loop matrix and multiple-loop matrix systems; and (ii) non-linear and time-varying SISO and MIMO plants, and to a more limited extent for plants with distributed control inputs and sensors. QFT has also been developed for single- and multiple-loop dithered non-linear (adaptive) systems with LTI plants, and for a special class (FORE) of non-linear compensation. New techniques have been found for handling non-minimum-phase (NMP) MIMO plants, plants with both zeros and poles in the right half-plane and LTI plants with incidental hard non-linearities such as saturation.},

  abstract = {We present an approach for approximately solving discrete-time stochastic optimal-control problems by combining direct trajectory optimization, deterministic sampling, and policy optimization. Our feedback motionplanning algorithm uses a quasi-Newton method to simultaneously optimize a reference trajectory, a set of deterministically chosen sample trajectories, and a parameterized policy. We demonstrate that this approach exactly recovers LQR policies in the case of linear dynamics, quadratic objective, and Gaussian disturbances. We also demonstrate the algorithm on several nonlinear, underactuated robotic systems to highlight its performance and ability to handle control limits, safely avoid obstacles, and generate robust plans in the presence of unmodeled dynamics.},

Comparison of the perspectives of faculty and their students revealed considerable agreement on the nature, range, and extent of students' UR gains. Specific student gains relating to the process of ``becoming a scientist'' were described and illustrated by both groups. Faculty framed these gains as part of professional socialization into the sciences. In contrast, students emphasized their personal and intellectual development, with little awareness of their socialization into professional practice. Viewing study findings through the lens of social constructivist learning theories demonstrates that the characteristics of these UR programs, how faculty practice UR in these colleges, and students' outcomes---including cognitive and personal growth and the development of a professional identity---strongly exemplify many facets of these theories, particularly, student-centered and situated learning as part of cognitive apprenticeship in a community of practice. {\copyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We compared our approach to two existing ones for the same model and found that it is about twice as fast as the existing ones. We also introduce four different robotic simulation experiments and compare the proposed method to the most common contact solver, the projected Gauss--Seidel (PGS) method. We show that, while both methods are very efficient in solving simple problems, the proposed method significantly outperforms the PGS method in more complicated contact scenarios. Simulating one time step of an 18-DOF quadruped robot with multiple contacts took less than 20 {$\mu$}s with a single core of a CPU. This is at least an order of magnitude faster than many other simulators which employ multiple relaxation methods to the major dynamic principles in order to boost their computational speed. The proposed simulation method is also stable at 50 Hz due to its strict adherence to the dynamical principles. Although the accuracy might be compromised at such a low update rate, this means that we can simulate an 18-DOF robot more than thousand times faster than the real time.},

  abstract = {Traditional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) immunity to interference may be approaching a practical performance ceiling. Greater gains are possible outside traditional GNSS orbits and spectrum. GNSS from low Earth orbit (LEO) has long been viewed as promising but expensive, requiring large constellations for rapid navigation solutions. The recent emergence of commercial broadband LEO mega-constellations invites study on dual-purposing these for both communications---their primary mission---and a secondary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service. Operating at shorter wavelengths than traditional GNSS, these constellations would permit highly directive, relatively compact receiver antennas. PNT-specific onorbit resources would not be required: the transmitters, antennas, clocks, and spectrum of the hosting broadband network would suffice for PNT. Non-cooperative use of LEO signals for PNT is an option, but cooperation with the constellation operator (``fusion'' with its communications mission) eases the burden of tracking a dense, low-altitude constellation from the ground and enables a receiver to produce single-epoch stand-alone PNT solutions. This paper proposes such a cooperative concept, termed fused LEO GNSS. Viability hinges on opportunity cost, or the burden a secondary PNT mission imposes on the communications constellation operator. This is assessed in terms of time-spacebandwidth product and energy budget. It is shown that a near-instantaneous-fix PNT service over {\textpm}60{\textopenbullet} latitude (covering 99.8\% of the world's population) with positioning performance superior to traditional GNSS pseudoranging would cost less than 1.6\% of downlink capacity for the largest of the new constellations, SpaceX's Starlink. This allocation is comparable to adding one user consuming 5.7 Mbps of broadband service to each cell.},

  abstract = {Missions with a small satellite constellation such as a multi-point simultaneous observation and communication network are being proposed all over the world. To achieve these missions, constellation deployment and keeping are the key technologies. Generally, thrusters are used for these technologies. Although the method with thrusters can accelerate satellites largely, thrusters take large space of small satellites. The other method without thrusters is using attitude maneuver of the satellites to control environmental forces such as aero drag and solar radiation pressure. This method can change satellites orbit without large devices, whereas this method takes a long time to change the orbit due to weak environmental force. To settle these issues, our research group proposed a constellation deployment and keeping method using jointed satellites separation by centrifugal force. Small satellites can be spun up in a short time owing to their small moment of inertia. The proposed method firstly spins up combined small satellites to a large angular velocity and separates them. Then, the satellites are accelerated, and their orbits are changed. Afterward, the difference in the phase angles between two satellites gradually becomes larger. Then, by controlling their orbit with environmental force, the two satellites form a constellation in along-track formation. With this method, satellites can form a constellation without large devices and in a shorter time than the method with only environmental force. To demonstrate this method, our research group is developing a cubesat called ``MAGNARO''. MAGNARO is composed of 2U and 1U cubesats, and they are connected with the magnetic force between magnetic holders on the 2U cubesat and iron plates on the 1U cubesat. In the mission, MAGNARO is spun up to 720 degrees/s, and 2U and 1U satellites get 1.3 m/s and 0.63 m/s delta-V, respectively by the separation. After that, with aero drag force, MAGNARO changes its orbit and forms a constellation in along-track formation. For high speed rotation, MAGNARO has large magnetic torquers that are also used as structure. In addition, to decrease the phase angle error in high speed rotation, MAGNARO performs precise attitude determination using an acceleration sensor. Currently, MAGNARO development is in the engineering model development phase, and the flight model development will be finished in 2021.},

Moreover, it allows to relax the assumption of maximum likelihood observations: predicted measurements are treated as random variables, and binary random variables are used to model the event that a measurement is actually taken by the robot. We successfully apply our approach to the problem of uncertainty-constrained exploration, in which the robot has to perform tasks in an unknown environment, while maintaining localization uncertainty within given bounds. We present an extensive numerical analysis of the proposed approach and compare it against related work. In practice, our planning approach produces smooth and natural trajectories and is able to impose soft upper bounds on the uncertainty. Finally, we exploit the results of this analysis to identify current limitations and show that the proposed framework can accommodate several desirable extensions.},

  abstract = {We investigate the problem of planning under uncertainty, with application to mobile robotics. We propose a probabilistic framework in which the robot bases its decisions on the generalized belief, which is a probabilistic description of its own state and of external variables of interest. The approach naturally leads to a dual-layer architecture: an inner estimation layer, which performs inference to predict the outcome of possible decisions; and an outer decisional layer which is in charge of deciding the best action to undertake. Decision making is entrusted to a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. The formulation is valid for general cost functions and does not discretize the state or control space, enabling planning in continuous domain. Moreover, it allows to relax the assumption of maximum likelihood observations: predicted measurements are treated as random variables, and binary random variables are used to model the event that a measurement is actually taken by the robot. We successfully apply our approach to the problem of uncertainty-constrained exploration, in which the robot has to perform tasks in an unknown environment, while maintaining localization uncertainty within given bounds. We present an extensive numerical analysis of the proposed approach and compare it against related work. In practice, our planning approach produces smooth and natural trajectories and is able to impose soft upper bounds on the uncertainty. Finally, we exploit the results of this analysis to identify current limitations and show that the proposed framework can accommodate several desirable extensions.},

  abstract = {Dynamic game theory provides mathematical means for modeling the interaction between several players, where their decisions are explained by individual cost functions. The inverse problem of dynamic games, where cost functions are sought which explain observed behavior, has recently gained attention due to its potential application for identification of biological systems and the possibility of generalizing inverse optimal control results. In this paper, we extend maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning to the N-player case in order to solve inverse dynamic games with continuous-valued state and control spaces. On this basis, we first present a method for identification of cost function parameters in a cooperative game. Afterwards, we propose an approach for identifying cost function parameters which explain the behavior of the players in a non-cooperative setting, i.e. open-loop and feedback Nash equilibrium behaviors. Furthermore, we give results on the unbiasedness of the estimation of cost function parameters for each class of inverse dynamic game. The applicability of the methods is demonstrated with simulation examples of a nonlinear and a linear-quadratic dynamic game.},

  abstract = {Magnetic control has been used for decades for spacecraft detumbling, i.e., to bring a spacecraft to a final condition with a sufficiently small angular momentum after separation from the launcher. This task is typically achieved by controllers based on the so-called b-dot principle, which stands out thanks to its simplicity, reliability and ease of on-board implementation. In this paper, we first review existing control methods and study their convergence properties with tools borrowed from general averaging theory, which allows addressing in an accurate manner the time-varying nature of magnetic actuation. Then, some effort is devoted to showing the performance limitations of existing controllers for which increasing the gain too much deteriorates the convergence rate. To overcome this issue, a novel projection-based control law with a state-dependent time-varying gain is presented. By means of Lyapunov arguments for non-autonomous systems, we prove that the proposed controller guarantees that the spacecraft angular momentum converges exponentially fast to zero for all initial conditions, robustly with respect to sufficiently small uncertainties in the inertia matrix, and that the closed-loop solutions are globally uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of exogenous bounded disturbances. Several numerical simulations have been carried out by referring to realistic detumbling scenarios to show the performance improvement with respect to existing controllers.},

  abstract = {Differential dynamic programming is a technique, based on dynamic programming rather than the calculus of variations, for determining the optimal control function of a nonlinear system. Unlike conventional dynamic programming where the optimal cost function is considered globally, differential dynamic programming applies the principle of optimality in the neighborhood of a nominal, possibly nonoptimal, trajectory. This allows the coefficients of a linear or quadratic expansion of the cost function to be computed in reverse time along the trajectory: these coefficients may then be used to yield a new improved trajectory (i.e., the algorithms are of the "successive sweep" type). A class of nonlinear control problems, linear in the control variables, is studied using differential dynamic programming. It is shown that for the free-end-point problem, the first partial derivatives of the optimal cost function are continuous throughout the state space, and the second partial derivatives experience jumps at switch points of the control function. A control problem that has an aualytic solution is used to illustrate these points. The fixed-end-point problem is converted into an equivalent free-end-point problem by adjoining the end-point constraints to the cost functional using Lagrange multipliers: a useful interpretation for Pontryagin's adjoint variables for this type of problem emerges from this treatment. The above results are used to devise new second- and first-order algorithms for determining the optimal bang-bang control by successively improving a nominal guessed control function. The usefulness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by the computation of a number of control problem examples.},

Provided, therefore, that one can afford the cost of a moderate number of flow solutions, procedures of this type can be used to derive improved designs. The approach is quite general, not limited to particular choices of the coordinate transformation or cost function, which might in fact contain measures of other criteria of performance such as lift and drag. For the sake of simplicity certain complicating factors, such as the need to include a special term in the mapping function to generate a corner at the trailing edge, have been suppressed from the present analysis.

Provided, therefore, that one can afford the cost of a moderate number of flow solutions, procedures of this type can be used to derive improved designs. The approach is quite general, not limited to particular choices of the coordinate transformation or cost function, which might in fact contain measures of other criteria of performance such as lift and drag. For the sake of simplicity certain complicating factors, such as the need to include a special term in the mapping function to generate a corner at the trailing edge, have been suppressed from the present analysis. Also it remains to explore the numerical implementation of the design procedures proposed in this paper.}

  abstract = {Recently, Semtech has released a Long Range (LoRa) chipset which operates at the globally available 2.4 GHz frequency band, on top of the existing sub-GHz, km-range offer, enabling hardware manufacturers to design region-independent chipsets. The SX1280 LoRa module promises an ultra-long communication range while withstanding heavy interference in this widely used band. In this paper, we first provide a mathematical description of the physical layer of LoRa in the 2.4 GHz band. Secondly, we investigate the maximum communication range of this technology in three different scenarios. Free space, indoor and urban path loss models are used to simulate the propagation of the 2.4 GHz LoRa modulated signal at different spreading factors and bandwidths. Additionally, we investigate the corresponding data rates. The results show a maximum range of 333 km in free space, 107 m in an indoor office-like environment and 867 m in an outdoor urban context. While a maximum data rate of 253.91 kbit/s can be achieved, the data rate at the longest possible range in every scenario equals 0.595 kbit/s. Due to the configurable bandwidth and lower data rates, LoRa outperforms other technologies in the 2.4 GHz band in terms of communication range. In addition, both communication and localization applications deployed in private LoRa networks can benefit from the increased bandwidth and localization accuracy of this system when compared to public sub-GHz networks.},

  abstract = {The Kilobot is a widely used platform for investigation of swarm robotics. Physical Kilobots are slow moving and require frequent recalibration and charging, which significantly slows down the development cycle. Simulators can speed up the process of testing, exploring and hypothesis generation, but usually require time consuming and error-prone translation of code between simulator and robot. Moreover, code of different nature often obfuscates direct comparison, as well as determination of the cause of deviation, between simulator and actual robot swarm behaviour. To tackle these issues we have developed a C-based simulator that allows those working with Kilobots to use the same programme code in both the simulator and the physical robots. Use of our simulator, coined Kilombo, significantly simplifies and speeds up development, given that a simulation of 1000 robots can be run at a speed 100 times faster than real time on a desktop computer, making high-throughput pre-screening possible of potential algorithms that could lead to desired emergent behaviour. We argue that this strategy, here specifically developed for Kilobots, is of general importance for effective robot swarm research. The source code is freely available under the MIT license.},

The three formulations are the classical Newtonian (N), the Kustaanheimo/Stiefel (K/S), and the Sperling/Burdet (S/B). The last two solutions are first regularized by the classical Sundman technique and the K/S solution is transformed before the optimization problem is posed. A novel technique is developed for generating initial control vectors for each solution. Numerically generated derivatives (central differences) are used by a type of gradient, Newton-Raphson iterator to converge the two-point boundary value problems. The results indicate that, although the K/S and S/B formulations are more difficult to express mathematically than the Newtonian formulation, the transformed solutions are significantly more numerically stable than the Newtonian solution when the perturbing acceleration is less than a minimum value (T/Wo=0.05 for the particular example problem treated).},

We investigate three learning modes of the PDP: inverse reinforcement learning, system identification, and control/planning, respectively.

Furthermore, fast simulation is desired for quickly exploring robot behaviors in the context of motion planning. In this paper, we examine a particular class of inflated-beam soft growing robots called ``vine robots'', and present a dynamics simulator that captures general behaviors, handles robot-object interactions, and runs faster than real time. The simulator framework uses a simplified multi-link, rigid-body model with contact constraints. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we develop methods for fitting model parameters based on video data of a robot in motion and in contact with an environment. We provide examples of simulations, including several with fit parameters, to show the qualitative and quantitative agreement between simulated and real behaviors. Our work demonstrates the capabilities of this high-speed dynamics simulator and its potential for use in the control of soft robots.},

The DRC Trials consisted of eight different challenges that tested robot mobility, manipulation, and control under degraded communications and time constraints. Team IHMC competed using the Atlas humanoid robot made by Boston Dynamics. We competed against 16 international teams and placed second in the competition. This article discusses the challenges we faced in transitioning from simulation to hardware. It also discusses the lessons learned both during the competition and in the months of preparation leading up to it. The lessons address the value of reliable hardware and solid software practices. They also cover effective approaches to bipedal walking and designing for human-robot teamwork. Lastly, the lessons present a philosophical discussion about choices related to designing robotic systems.},

While they are not energy-preserving they do exhibit long-time stable energy behavior. However, variational integrators often simulate mechanical system dynamics by solving an implicit difference equation at each time step, one that is moreover expressed purely in terms of configurations at different time steps. This paper formulates the first- and second-order linearizations of a variational integrator in a manner that is amenable to control analysis and synthesis, creating a bridge between existing analysis and optimal control tools for discrete dynamic systems and variational integrators for mechanical systems in generalized coordinates with forcing and holonomic constraints. The forced pendulum is used to illustrate the technique. A second example solves the discrete Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem to find a locally stabilizing controller for a 40 DOF system with six constraints.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In the context of increasing use of moving wireless sensor nodes the interest in localizing these nodes in their application environment is strongly rising. For many applications, it is necessary to know the exact position of the nodes in two- or three-dimensional space. Commonly used nodes use state-of-the-art transceivers like the CC430 from Texas Instruments with integrated signal strength measurement for this purpose. This has the disadvantage, that the signal strength measurement is strongly dependent on the orientation of the node through the antennas inhomogeneous radiation pattern as well as it has a small accuracy on long ranges. Also, the nodes overall attenuation and output power has to be calibrated and interference and multipath effects appear in closed environments. Another possibility to trilaterate the position of a sensor node is the time of flight measurement. This has the advantage, that the position can also be estimated on long ranges, where signal strength methods give only poor accuracy. In this paper we present an investigation of the suitability of the state-of-the-art transceiver CC430 for a system based on time of flight methods and give an overview of the optimal settings under various circumstances for the in-field application. For this investigation, the systematic and statistical errors in the time of flight measurements with the CC430 have been investigated under a multitude of parameters. Our basic system does not use any additional components but only the given standard hardware, which can be found on the Texas Instruments evaluation board for a CC430. Thus, it can be implemented on already existent sensor node networks by a simple software upgrade.},

Mission requirements analysis and attitude system requirements derivation are presented, followed by actuator tradeoff and selection, with a detailed design of the complete attitude control system, including the air-cored type of magnetorquer actuators and their drivers, made of H-bridge and filtering components. The design is based on several theoretical and practical considerations with emphasis on the high-power efficiency, such as effects of parallel and serial magnetorquer connections, modeling the magnetorquers with equivalent circuit models for finding a suitable driving frequency and extrapolation methods for efficient dipole moment usage. The in-house manufacturing process of magnetorquers, using a custom 3-D-printer setup, is described. Finally, the testing and verification are performed, by measuring the performance of the manufactured hardware, circuit simulations, and attitude control simulations. It is shown that the manufactured attitude control system fulfills all system requirements. Simulations also confirm the capability to satisfy mission requirements.},

  abstract = {Many robotics problems are challenging because it is necessary to estimate state based on noisy or incomplete measurements. In these partially observable control problems, the system must act in order to gain information while attempting to maximize the probability of achieving task goals. Recently, there has been an effort to solve partially observable problems by planning in belief space, the space of probability distributions over the underlying state of the system. However, one of the challenges is to plan effectively in high-dimensional belief spaces. This paper identifies a class of partially observable problems with state dependent noise for which planning can be expressed as a convex program. We also propose a method by which non-convex problems that are composed of a small number of convex ``pieces'' can be solved using integer programming. The convex sub-structure means that these integer programs are small and can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf solvers. We also extend the integer programming formulation to incorporate chance constraints on the probability of colliding with an obstacle. Our approach is demonstrated in the context of micro air vehicle single- and multi-beacon navigation problems.},

By using this idea, we can generalize our previous method that is based on the availability of global bisimulation functions. We also propose a computational scheme for constructing the local barrier functions and their domains of validity, which is based on the S-procedure. We demonstrate that our method subsumes some other existing methods as special cases, and that for polynomial systems the computation can be implemented using sum-of-squares programming.},

  abstract = {The Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model  is an engineering-level atmospheric model widely used for diverse mission applications. Mars-GRAM has been utilized during previous aerobraking operations in the atmosphere of Mars. Mars-GRAM has also been used in the prediction and validation of Mars Pathfinder hypersonic aerodynamics, the aerothermodynamic and entry dynamics studies for Mars Polar Lander, the landing site selection process for the Mars Science Laboratory , the Mars Aerocapture System Study  as well as the Aerocapture Technology Assessment Group . Most recently, Mars-GRAM 2010 was used to develop the onboard atmospheric density estimator that is part of the Autonomous Aerobraking Development Plan. The most recent release of Mars-GRAM 2010 contains several changes including an update to Fortran 90/95 and the addition of adjustment factors. Following the completion of a comparison analysis between Mars-GRAM, Thermal Emission Spectrometer , as well as Mars Global Surveyor , Mars Odyssey , and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  aerobraking density data, adjustment factors were added to Mars-GRAM 2010 that alter the input data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration  Ames Mars General Circulation Model  and the University of Michigan Mars Thermospheric General Circulation Model  for the mapping year 0 user-controlled dust case. The addition of adjustment factors resolved the issue of previous versions of Mars-GRAM being less than realistic when used for sensitivity studies for mapping year 0 and large optical depth values, such as tau equal to 3. Mars-GRAM was evaluated at locations and times of TES limb observations and adjustment factors were determined. For altitudes above 80 km and below 135 km, Mars-GRAM  densities were compared to aerobraking densities measured by Mars Global Surveyor , Mars Odyssey , and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  to determine the adjustment factors. The adjustment factors generated by this process had to satisfy the gas law as well as the hydrostatic relation and are expressed as a function of height , Latitude  and areocentric solar longitude . The greatest adjustments are made at large optical depths such as tau greater than 1. The addition of the adjustment factors has led to better correspondence to TES Limb data from 0-60 km altitude as well as better agreement with MGS, ODY and MRO data at approximately 90-130 km altitude. Improved Mars-GRAM atmospheric simulations for various locations, times and dust conditions on Mars will be presented at the workshop session. The latest results validating Mars-GRAM 2010 versus Mars Climate Sounder data will also be presented. Mars-GRAM 2010 updates have resulted in improved atmospheric simulations which will be very important when beginning systems design, performance analysis, and operations planning for future aerocapture, aerobraking or landed missions to Mars.},

  abstract = {Geckos are nature's elite climbers. Their remarkable climbing feats have been attributed to specialized feet with hairy toes that uncurl and peel in milliseconds. Here, we report that the secret to the gecko's arboreal acrobatics includes an active tail. We examine the tail's role during rapid climbing, aerial descent, and gliding. We show that a gecko's tail functions as an emergency fifth leg to prevent falling during rapid climbing. A response initiated by slipping causes the tail tip to push against the vertical surface, thereby preventing pitch-back of the head and upper body. When pitch-back cannot be prevented, geckos avoid falling by placing their tail in a posture similar to a bicycle's kickstand. Should a gecko fall with its back to the ground, a swing of its tail induces the most rapid, zero-angular momentum air-righting response yet measured. Once righted to a sprawled gliding posture, circular tail movements control yaw and pitch as the gecko descends. Our results suggest that large, active tails can function as effective control appendages. These results have provided biological inspiration for the design of an active tail on a climbing robot, and we anticipate their use in small, unmanned gliding vehicles and multisegment spacecraft.},

This book contains a large collection of problems that complement it and are an important part of piece, in addition to numerous sections that offer interesting historical accounts and insights. The book also includes several results that appear in print for the first time.  FEATURES/BENEFITS     Takes a geometric point of view.   Emphasis on the numerically favored array forms of many algorithms.   Emphasis on equivalence and duality concepts for the solution of several related problems in adaptive filtering, estimation, and control.  These features are generally absent in most prior treatments, ostensibly on the grounds that they are too abstract and complicated. It is the authors' hope that these misconceptions will be dispelled by the presentation herein, and that the fundamental simplicity and power of these ideas will be more widely recognized and exploited. Among other things, these features already yielded new insights and new results for linear and nonlinear problems in areas such as adaptive filtering, quadratic control, and estimation, including the recent H{\`a} theories.},

The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory, which are then combined to produced an updated trajectory with lower cost. A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.},

We concentrate in this paper on analyzing the tradeoffs between maintaining dynamic roadmaps and applying an on-line bidirectional rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) planner alone, which requires no preprocessing or maintenance. We ground the analysis in several benchmarks in virtual environments with randomly moving obstacles. Different robotics structures are used, including a 17 degrees of freedom model of NASA's Robonaut humanoid. Our results show that dynamic roadmaps can be both faster and more capable for planning difficult motions than using on-line planning alone. In particular, we investigate its scalability to 3D workspaces and higher dimensional configurations spaces, as our main interest is the application of the method to interactive domains involving humanoids.},

Hole search is a crucial step in peg-in-hole since it aligns the peg and hole where the positional uncertainty is presented. This study introduces a hole search strategy by computing an exploration distribution based on uncertainty analysis. Our method firstly utilizes vision to estimate the hole's pose. It then performs an uncertainty analysis based on vision estimation and systematic configures to compute the exploration distribution of the hole search. The computed exploration distribution calculates a search trajectory through the distribution and finds the hole. The effectiveness of the search strategy is experimentally verified using a robot manipulator in the peg-in-hole of the optical transceiver, which is a challenging task that has not yet been addressed. The results confirm that the proposed search strategy can achieve a 90\% success rate on the hole search. Through the rational design of the recovery strategy, our method can secure a 100\% success rate on the robotic peg-in-hole of apparatus with a small clearance (0.1 mm).},

  abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms, e.g., in terms of a given cost function, have been established so far. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by designing efficient incremental samplingbased algorithms with provable optimality properties. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path returned by RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value, as the number of samples increases. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path returned by RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called RRT*⬚, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT⬚* algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control technique that handles constraints, takes the system's dynamics into account, and optimizes for a given cost function. In practice, however, it often requires an expert to craft and tune this cost function and find trade-offs between different state penalties to satisfy simple high level objectives. In this paper, we use Reinforcement Learning and in particular value learning to approximate the value function given only high level objectives , which can be sparse and binary. Building upon previous works, we present improvements that allowed us to successfully deploy the method on a real world unmanned ground vehicle. Our experiments show that our method can learn the cost function from scratch and without human intervention , while reaching a performance level similar to that of an expert-tuned MPC. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods with standard MPC approaches both in simulation and on the real robot. A demonstration of our method can be seen in the video: https://youtu.be/PJB8XdXBP\_M},

  abstract = {The Sun Radio Interferometer Space Experiment (SunRISE) would provide an entirely new view on particle acceleration and transport in the inner heliosphere by creating the first low radio frequency interferometer in space to localize heliospheric radio emissions. By imaging and determining the location of decametric-hectometric (DH) radio bursts from 0.1 MHz--25 MHz, SunRISE would provide key information on particle acceleration mechanisms associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the magnetic field topology from active regions into interplanetary space. Six small spacecraft, of a 6U form factor, would fly in a supersynchronous geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) orbit within about 10 km of each other, in a passive formation, and image the Sun in a portion of the spectrum that is blocked by the ionosphere and cannot be observed from Earth. Key aspects that enable this mission concept are that only position knowledge of the spacecraft is required, not active control, and that the architecture involves a modest amount of on-board processing coupled with significant ground-based processing for navigation, position determination, and science operations. Mission-enabling advances in software-defined radios, GPS navigation and timing, and small spacecraft technologies, developed and flown over the past few years on DARPA High Frequency Research (DHFR), the Community Initiative for Continuing Earth Radio Occultation (CICERO), and the Mars Cube One (MarCO) missions, have made this concept affordable and low-risk. The SunRISE concept would involve utilizing commercial access to space, in which the SunRISE spacecraft would be carried to their target orbit as a secondary payload in conjunction with a larger host spacecraft intended for GEO.},

Each pilot sees the environment from the perspective of their drone by means of video streamed from an onboard camera. Reaching the level of professional pilots with an autonomous drone is challenging because the robot needs to fly at its physical limits while estimating its speed and location in the circuit exclusively from onboard sensors1. Here we introduce Swift, an autonomous system that can race physical vehicles at the level of the human world champions. The system combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation with data collected in the physical world. Swift competed against three human champions, including the world champions of two international leagues, in real-world head-to-head races. Swift won several races against each of the human champions and demonstrated the fastest recorded race time. This work represents a milestone for mobile robotics and machine intelligence2, which may inspire the deployment of hybrid learning-based solutions in other physical systems.},

  abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-freeconfigurationsand whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose. Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (E 150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).},

It is often used as a post-processing operation to smooth out trajectories that are generated by probabilistic methods or to directly control the robot motion. Unconstrained trajectory optimization problems have been well studied, and are commonly solved using Differential Dynamic Programming methods that allow for fast convergence at a relatively low computational cost. In this paper, we propose an augmented Lagrangian approach that extends these ideas to equality-constrained trajectory optimization problems, while maintaining a balance between convergence speed and numerical stability. We illustrate our contributions on various standard robotic problems and highlights their benefits compared to standard approaches.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Sampling-based motion planning algorithms are effective for these high-dimensional systems; however, incorporating task constraints (e.g., keeping a cup level or writing on a board) into the planning process introduces significant challenges. This survey describes the families of methods for sampling-based planning with constraints and places them on a spectrum delineated by their complexity. Constrained sampling-based methods are based on two core primitive operations: (a) sampling constraint-satisfying configurations and (b) generating constraint-satisfying continuous motion. Although this article presents the basics of sampling-based planning for contextual background, it focuses on the representation of constraints and sampling-based planners that incorporate constraints.},

  abstract = {ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research In Astrophysics) is a 6U CubeSat space telescope (10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm, 10 kg). ASTERIA's primary mission objective was demonstrating two key technologies for reducing systematic noise in photometric observations: high-precision pointing control and high-stabilty thermal control. ASTERIA demonstrated 0.5 arcsecond RMS pointing stability and \${\textbackslash}pm\$10 milliKelvin thermal control of its camera payload during its primary mission, a significant improvement in pointing and thermal performance compared to other spacecraft in ASTERIA's size and mass class. ASTERIA launched in August 2017 and deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) November 2017. During the prime mission (November 2017 -- February 2018) and the first extended mission that followed (March 2018 - May 2018), ASTERIA conducted opportunistic science observations which included collection of photometric data on 55 Cancri, a nearby exoplanetary system with a super-Earth transiting planet. The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom pipeline to correct CMOS detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was used to simultaneously detrend the photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model. ASTERIA made a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e (\${\textbackslash}sim2\${\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}Rearth), measuring a transit depth of \$374{\textbackslash}pm170\$ ppm. This is the first detection of an exoplanet transit by a CubeSat. The successful detection of super-Earth 55 Cancri e demonstrates that small, inexpensive spacecraft can deliver high-precision photometric measurements.},

Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

The rich mathematical literature on this subject greatly advances our ability to determine the presence of an essentially globally attracting fixed point-the formal ren dering of what we intuitively mean by a "correct" strat egy.

  abstract = {Robotic solutions to clothing assistance can significantly improve quality of life for the elderly and disabled. Real-time estimation of the human-cloth relationship is crucial for efficient learning of motor skills for robotic clothing assistance. The major challenge involved is cloth-state estimation due to inherent nonrigidity and occlusion. In this study, we present a novel framework for real-time estimation of the cloth state using a low-cost depth sensor, making it suitable for a feasible social implementation. The framework relies on the hypothesis that clothing articles are constrained to a low-dimensional latent manifold during clothing tasks. We propose the use of manifold relevance determination (MRD) to learn an offline cloth model that can be used to perform informed cloth-state estimation in real time. The cloth model is trained using observations from a motion capture system and depth sensor. MRD provides a principled probabilistic framework for inferring the accurate motion-capture state when only the noisy depth sensor feature state is available in real time. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework is capable of learning consistent task-specific latent features using few data samples and has the ability to generalize to unseen environmental settings. We further present several factors that affect the predictive performance of the learned cloth-state model.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift (or embed) the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to numerical approximations of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and apply the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) to compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form of a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple-it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system with the same number of control inputs and the same dimension of the state-space. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. We treat both the full-state measurement case and the input-output case, as well as systems with disturbances/noise. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach. 1},

We derive a coordinate-free dynamical model of the system. We use singular-perturbations to show that a geometric controller developed for the case of an inelastic cable still works for the case of an elastic cable to achieve almost global exponential tracking of a desired load position to within a certain bound. We provide numerical results to validate the proposed controller for various spring and damping coefficients for the cable.},

In this paper, we present a new approach for robust MPC synthesis that allows explicit incorporation of the description of plant uncertainty in the problem formulation. The uncertainty is expressed in both the time and frequency domains. The goal is to design, at each time step, a state-feedback control law that minimizes a `worst-case' infinite horizon objective function, subject to constraints on the control input and plant output. Using standard techniques, the problem of minimizing an upper bound on the `worst-case' objective function, subject to input and output constraints, is reduced to a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown that the feasible receding horizon state-feedback control design robustly stabilizes the set of uncertain plants. Several extensions, such as application to systems with time delays, problems involving constant set-point tracking, trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection, which follow naturally from our formulation, are discussed. The controller design is illustrated with two examples.},

The paper focused on the guided atmospheric entry as a predominant phase in achieving a desired target state, as compared with the following parachute and powered descent. The predictive algorithms for the longitudinal guidance of a low-lift entry vehicle are treated. The purpose is to investigate applicability of the predictive strategy under possible high discrepancies between the on-board dynamic model and real environment while in entry trajectory. The comparative performance analysis based on computer simulation has been made between the standard one-parametric ``shooting'' predictive algorithm and a more complex two-parametric algorithm providing lower final velocity and, thus, expanding the interval of admissible downrange. However, both algorithms display considerable degradation of downrange accuracy in the cases when the actual drag force is larger than the modelled one. An acceptable solution has been found by including to both predictive guidance schemes an identification algorithm that repeatedly adapts the on-board model to varied environment in real time scale.},

Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a '7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 30, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3 0 workspace.

Differential drag is caused when the ballistic coefficients of the spacecraft in a formation are not equal. The magnitude of differential drag depends on the difference in ballistic coefficients and also the altitude of the spacecraft formation. AGI's Satellite Tool Kit (STK) is used initially to assess the magnitude of drifts caused due to differential drag for different altitudes. This information is then used to show that it is feasible to use differential drag for spacecraft formation control. A simple PID controller is then implemented that adjusts the cross- sectional areas of the satellites such that the energies of the orbits remain equal. Results are presented that show that the control law can maintain the formation separation with reasonable accuracy.},

The new hybrid method incorporates nonlinear mathematical programming techniques to increase efficiency: quadratic programming subproblems are solved via trust region and range-space active set methods, an augmented Lagrangian cost function is utilized, and a multiphase structure is implemented. In addition, the algorithm decouples the optimization from the dynamics using first- and second-order state transition matrices.

The accuracy of the algorithm is assessed using comparisons with results obtained by manually sizing the imaged crystals. The algorithm can accurately extract crystal size information from in situ images of suspended, high-aspect-ratio crystals for moderate solids concentrations. The algorithm's performance declines somewhat for high solids concentrations and high levels of particle attrition. The speed with which the algorithm analyzes the images is suitable for real-time monitoring and control of particle size distribution mean and variance.},

Reliable algorithms leading to symmetric equation systems are highly desirable, especially in three-dimensional problems where the computational cost is dominated by equation solving. In this paper such an algorithm symmetrization is proposed. The method is derived from the augmented Lagrangian treatment of friction given by Simo and Laursen (Comput. \& Structures 42 (1992) 97--116), and exploits the iterative nature of the classical method of multipliers. More specifically, symmetrization is achieved by a modified multiplier update scheme in which all nonassociativity is removed from the solution phase and placed in the multiplier update phase. The result is an algorithm involving only the solution of symmetric equations, which maintains the attributes of an augmented Lagrangian method.},

In this paper, we present an empirical study comparing the performance of unscented and extended Kalman filtering for improving human head and hand tracking. Specifically, we examine human head and hand orientation motion signals, represented with quaternions, which are critical for correct viewing perspectives in virtual reality. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that unscented Kalman filtering performs equivalently with extended Kalman filtering. However, the additional computational overhead of the unscented Kalman filter and quasi-linear nature of the quaternion dynamics lead to the conclusion that the extended Kalman filter is a better choice for estimating quaternion motion in virtual reality applications.},

We find that most of the known extrasolar planets should emit in the frequency range 10--1000 MHz and, under favorable circumstances, have typical flux densities as large as 1 mJy. We also describe an initial, systematic effort to search for radio emission in low radio frequency images acquired with the Very Large Array (VLA). The limits set by the VLA images (\%300 mJy) are consistent with, but do not provide strong constraints on, the predictions of the model. Future radio telescopes, such as the Low Frequency Array and the Square Kilometer Array, should be able to detect the known extrasolar planets or place austere limits on their radio emission. Planets with masses much lower than those in the current census will probably radiate below 10 MHz and will require a space-based array.},

This paper introduces LUCIDGames, an inverse optimal control algorithm that is able to estimate the other agents' objective functions in real time, and incorporate those estimates online into a receding-horizon game-theoretic planner. LUCIDGames solves the inverse optimal control problem by recasting it in a recursive parameter-estimation framework. LUCIDGames uses an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to iteratively update a Bayesian estimate of the other agents' cost function parameters, improving that estimate online as more data is gathered from the other agents' observed trajectories. The planner then takes account of the uncertainty in the Bayesian parameter estimates of other agents by planning a trajectory for the robot subject to uncertainty ellipse constraints. The algorithm assumes no explicit communication or coordination between the robot and the other agents in the environment. An MPC implementation of LUCIDGames demonstrates real-time performance on complex autonomous driving scenarios with an update frequency of 40 Hz. Empirical results demonstrate that LUCIDGames improves the robot's performance over existing game-theoretic and traditional MPC planning approaches.},

  abstract = {We present an efficient variational integrator for simulating multibody systems. Variational integrators reformulate the equations of motion for multibody systems as discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equation, transforming forward integration into a root-finding problem for the DEL equation. Variational integrators have been shown to be more robust and accurate in preserving fundamental properties of systems, such as momentum and energy, than many frequently used numerical integrators. However, state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from O(n3) complexity, which is prohibitive for articulated multibody systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, n, in generalized coordinates. Our key contribution is to derive a quasi-Newton algorithm that solves the root-finding problem for the DEL equation in O(n), which scales up well for complex multibody systems such as humanoid robots. Our key insight is that the evaluation of DEL equation can be cast into a discrete inverse dynamic problem while the approximation of inverse Jacobian can be cast into a continuous forward dynamic problem. Inspired by Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA) and Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA), we formulate the DEL equation individually for each body rather than for the entire system, such that both inverse and forward dynamic problems can be solved efficiently in O(n). We demonstrate scalability and efficiency of the variational integrator through several case studies.},

Despite its importance, computation complexity limits its use. Motivated by recent work in using the Hopf formula for a grid-free solution to Hamilton-Jacobi equations for linear systems, this paper proposes an iterative method that provides a sub-optimal solution and corresponding control law for the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations for nonlinear systems. This allows efficient computation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions in high dimensions, for a broader class of systems than has been treated in prior work, and also provides a conservative solution that guarantees goal-reaching in goal-reaching problems or safety in collision avoidance problems. We name our method the Iterative Hopf Method. We demonstrate our method in two examples: goal-reaching and collision avoidance problems with a three-dimensional vehicle model to analyze performance of the iterative Hopf method by comparing with the level set method for computing a convergent solution to Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and a goal-reaching problem with a seven-dimensional vehicle whose computation for the solution is considered to be intractable.},

  abstract = {We present Aquarium, a differentiable fluid-structure interaction solver for robotics that offers stable simulation, accurate coupled robot-fluid physics, and full differentiability with respect to fluid states, robot states, and shape parameters. Aquarium achieves stable simulation with accurate flow physics by integrating over the discrete, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations directly using a fully-implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme with a second-order finite-volume spatial discretization. The robot and fluid physics are coupled using the immersed boundary method by formulating the no-slip condition as an equality constraint applied directly to the Navier-Stokes system. This choice of coupling allows the fluid-structure interaction to be posed and solved as a nonlinear optimization problem. This optimization-based formulation is then exploited using the implicit-function theorem to compute derivatives. The derivatives can then be passed to a gradient-based optimization or learning framework. We demonstrate Aquarium's ability to accurately simulate coupled fluid-solid physics with numerous examples, including a cylinder in free stream and a soft robotic tail with hardware validation. We also demonstrate Aquarium's ability to provide full, analytical gradients by performing both shape and gait optimization of a robotic fish tail to maximize generated thrust.},

However, the capability of low-power spacecraft processors to handle the real-time computational load of this technique still needs to be fully established, especially for complex control problems. This paper introduces a method to improve the computational efficiency of model predictive control when applied to the problem of autonomous rendezvous and proximity maneuvering using low-thrust propulsion. To ensure safe trajectories in this scenario, a long control horizon is required and the control problem must be solved at a relatively fast sampling rate. The proposed design addresses such requirements by parameterizing the thrust profile with a set of Laguerre functions. In this setting, the number of control variables can be made significantly smaller than the length of the control horizon, as opposed to standard design methods. By exploiting this property, in combination with multiparametric programming techniques, an explicit control law is derived that is suitable for real-time implementation on simple hardware. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a small spacecraft mission and compared with that of other control techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method for deploying a nanosatellite constellation to several orbital planes from a single launch vehicle. The method is based on commercially available deorbit devices that are used to lower the initial orbit, and that are discarded after the correct altitude has been reached. Nodal precession of the right ascension of the ascending node at different altitudes results in spreading the orbital planes of the satellites. Maneuvering all satellites to a similar final altitude freezes the relative separation of the orbital planes. Calculations and simulations of the method are presented, and the results indicate that with a launch of 6 satellites to an initial 800 km sun-synchronous orbit, orbital plane separation of approximately 30{$^\circ$} between each satellite can be achieved within 5 years, with each satellite in its own final 600 km orbital plane. Such a constellation could provide continuous global coverage, while requiring only one launch vehicle. Due to the timescales required by the method, it is best suited for nanosatellite missions designed for long lifetimes. Possible applications of such constellations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The success of CNNs in various applications is accompanied by a significant increase in the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts toward reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting original accuracy. However, magnitude-based pruning of weights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected layers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional layers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole filters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the computation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34\% and ResNet-110 by up to 38\% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.},

The Koopman operator theory lays the foundation for identifying the nonlinear-to-linear coordinate transformations with data-driven methods. Recently, researchers have proposed to use deep neural networks as a more expressive class of basis functions for calculating the Koopman operators. These approaches, however, assume a fixed dimensional state space; they are therefore not applicable to scenarios with a variable number of objects. In this paper, we propose to learn compositional Koopman operators, using graph neural networks to encode the state into object-centric embeddings and using a block-wise linear transition matrix to regularize the shared structure across objects. The learned dynamics can quickly adapt to new environments of unknown physical parameters and produce control signals to achieve a specified goal. Our experiments on manipulating ropes and controlling soft robots show that the proposed method has better efficiency and generalization ability than existing baselines.},

  abstract = {Contacts weave through every aspect of our physical world, from daily household chores to acts of nature. Modeling and predictive computation of these phenomena for solid mechanics is important to every discipline concerned with the motion of mechanical systems, including engineering and animation. Nevertheless, efficiently time-stepping accurate and consistent simulations of real-world contacting elastica remains an outstanding computational challenge. To model the complex interaction of deforming solids in contact we propose Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) - a new model and algorithm for variationally solving implicitly time-stepped nonlinear elastodynamics. IPC maintains an intersection- and inversion-free trajectory regardless of material parameters, time step sizes, impact velocities, severity of deformation, or boundary conditions enforced.             Constructed with a custom nonlinear solver, IPC enables efficient resolution of time-stepping problems with separate, user-exposed accuracy tolerances that allow independent specification of the physical accuracy of the dynamics and the geometric accuracy of surface-to-surface conformation. This enables users to decouple, as needed per application, desired accuracies for a simulation's dynamics and geometry.             The resulting time stepper solves contact problems that are intersection-free (and thus robust), inversion-free, efficient (at speeds comparable to or faster than available methods that lack both convergence and feasibility), and accurate (solved to user-specified accuracies). To our knowledge this is the first implicit time-stepping method, across both the engineering and graphics literature that can consistently enforce these guarantees as we vary simulation parameters.                            In an extensive comparison of available simulation methods, research libraries and commercial codes we confirm that available engineering and computer graphics methods, while each succeeding admirably in custom-tuned regimes, often fail with instabilities, egregious constraint violations and/or inaccurate and implausible solutions, as we vary input materials, contact numbers and time step. We also exercise IPC across a wide range of existing and new benchmark tests and demonstrate its accurate solution over a broad sweep of reasonable time-step sizes and beyond (up to               h               = 2s) across challenging large-deformation, large-contact stress-test scenarios with meshes composed of up to 2.3M tetrahedra and processing up to 498K contacts per time step. For applications requiring high-accuracy we demonstrate tight convergence on all measures. While, for applications requiring lower accuracies, e.g. animation, we confirm IPC can ensure feasibility and plausibility even when specified tolerances are lowered for efficiency.},

Traditional model-based locomotion controllers require simplifying assumptions and careful modelling; any small errors can result in unstable control. To address these challenges for bipedal locomotion, we present a model-free reinforcement learning framework for training robust locomotion policies in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. To facilitate sim-to-real transfer, domain randomization is used to encourage the policies to learn behaviors that are robust across variations in system dynamics. The learned policies enable Cassie to perform a set of diverse and dynamic behaviors, while also being more robust than traditional controllers and prior learning-based methods that use residual control. We demonstrate this on versatile walking behaviors such as tracking a target walking velocity, walking height, and turning yaw. (Video).}

This enables a unified, interpenetration-free, robust, and stable simulation framework that couples codimension-0,1,2, and 3 geometries seamlessly with frictional contact. Extending IPC to thin structures poses new challenges in computing strain, modeling thickness and determining collisions. To address these challenges we propose three corresponding contributions. First, we introduce a C2 constitutive barrier model that directly enforces strain limiting as an energy potential while preserving rest state. This provides energetically-consistent strain limiting models (both isotropic and anisotropic) for cloth that enable strict satisfaction of strain-limit inequalities with direct coupling to both elastodynamics and contact via minimization of the incremental potential. Second, to capture the geometric thickness of codimensional domains we extend the IPC model to directly enforce distance offsets. Our treatment imposes a strict guarantee that mid-surfaces (resp. mid-lines) of shells (resp. rods) will not move closer than applied thickness values. This enables us to account for thickness in the contact behavior of codimensional structures and so robustly capture challenging contacting geometries; a number of which, to our knowledge, have not been simulated before. Third, codimensional models, especially with modeled thickness, mandate strict accuracy requirements that pose a severe challenge to all existing continuous collision detection (CCD) methods. To address these limitations we develop a new, efficient, simple-to-implement additive CCD (ACCD) method that applies conservative advancement to iteratively refine a lower bound for deforming primitives, converging to time of impact.},

These methods require explicit task information in terms of a reward function or an expert that can be queried in simulation to provide a target control output, which limits their applicability. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial method for inferring reward functions from partial and potentially physically incompatible demonstrations for successful skill acquirement where reference or expert demonstrations are not easily accessible. Moreover, we show that by using a Wasserstein GAN formulation and transitions from demonstrations with rough and partial information as input, we are able to extract policies that are robust and capable of imitating demonstrated behaviors. Finally, the obtained skills such as a backflip are tested on an agile quadruped robot called Solo 8 and present faithful replication of hand-held human demonstrations.}

For many applications, the approximately convex components of this decomposition provide similar benefits as convex components, while the resulting decomposition is significantly smaller and can be computed more efficiently. Moreover, our approximate convex decomposition (ACD) provides a mechanism to focus on key structural features and ignore less significant artifacts such as wrinkles and surface texture; a user specified tolerance determines allowable concavity. We propose a simple algorithm that computes an ACD of a polygon by iteratively removing (resolving) the most significant non-convex feature (notch). As a by product, it produces an elegant hierarchical representation that provides a series of `increasingly convex' decompositions. Our algorithm computes an ACD of a simple polygon with n vertices and r notches in O(nr) time. In contrast, exact convex decomposition is NP-hard or, if the polygon has no holes, takes O(nr2) time.},

Recent success in deep reinforcement learning provides a promising direction for learning to manipulate deformable objects with data driven methods. However, existing reinforcement learning benchmarks only cover tasks with direct state observability and simple low-dimensional dynamics or with relatively simple image-based environments, such as those with rigid objects. In this paper, we present SoftGym, a set of open-source simulated benchmarks for manipulating deformable objects, with a standard OpenAI Gym API and a Python interface for creating new environments. Our benchmark will enable reproducible research in this important area. Further, we evaluate a variety of algorithms on these tasks and highlight challenges for reinforcement learning algorithms, including dealing with a state representation that has a high intrinsic dimensionality and is partially observable. The experiments and analysis indicate the strengths and limitations of existing methods in the context of deformable object manipulation that can help point the way forward for future methods development.

Under the constraint nondegeneracy condition and the strong second order sufficient condition, we demonstrate that the sequence of iterate points generated by the augmented Lagrangian method locally converges to a local minimizer at a linear rate, whose ratio constant is proportional to 1/{$\tau$} with penalty parameter {$\tau$} not less than a threshold {$\tau$}{\textasciicircum} {$>$} 0. Importantly and interestingly enough, the analysis does not require the strict complementarity condition.},

  abstract = {Convex optimization is a class of mathematical programming problems with polynomial complexity for which state-of-the-art, highly efficient numerical algorithms with predeterminable computational bounds exist. Computational efficiency and tractability in aerospace engineering, especially in guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&C), are of paramount importance. With theoretical guarantees on solutions and computational efficiency, convex optimization lends itself as a very appealing tool. Coinciding the strong drive toward autonomous operations of aerospace vehicles, convex optimization has seen rapidly increasing utility in solving aerospace GN\&C problems with the potential for onboard real-time applications. This paper attempts to provide an overview on the problems to date in aerospace guidance, path planning, and control where convex optimization has been applied. Various convexification techniques are reviewed that have been used to convexify the originally nonconvex aerospace problems. Discussions on how to ensure the validity of the convexification process are provided. Some related implementation issues will be introduced as well.},

One of the main components that will require careful design for CubeSats is their antennas, as they are needed to be lightweight, small in size, and compact or deployable for larger antennas. This paper presents a review of antennas suitable for picosatellite applications. An overview of the applications of picosatellites will first be explained, prior to a discussion on their antenna requirements. Material and antenna topologies which have been used will be subsequently discussed prior to the presentation of several deployable configurations. Finally, a perspective and future research work on CubeSat antennas will be discussed in the conclusion.}

In this paper the b-dot law is reviewed, a novel convergence analysis based on tools from averaging theory and periodic Lyapunov theory is presented and a simulation study is used to illustrate the results.},

Based on the linearization of the dynamics of the spacecraft and the modal identities about the flexible and rigid coupling matrices, the spacecraft attitude dynamics is reduced to a formally singular system with periodically varying parameters, which is quite different from a spacecraft with fixed appendages. In the framework of the singular control theory, the regularity and impulse-freeness of the singular system is analyzed and then admissible attitude controllers are designed by Lyapunov's method. To improve the robustness against system uncertainties, an H1 optimal control is designed by optimizing the H1 norm of the system transfer function matrix. Comparative numerical experiments are performed to verify the theoretical results.},

In the United States, most of these datasets are developed using the Cooperative Observer (COOP) network of ground-based precipitation measurements, interpolation, and the Parameter--Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) to map these measurements to places where data are not available. Here, we evaluate two daily datasets gridded at 1/168 resolution against independent daily observations from over 100 snow pillows in California's Sierra Nevada from 1990 to 2010. Over the entire period, the gridded datasets performed reasonably well, with median total water-year errors generally falling within 610\%. However, errors in individual storm events sometimes exceeded 50\% for the median difference across all stations, and in many cases, the same underpredicted storms appear in both datasets. Synoptic analysis reveals that these underpredicted storms coincide with 700-hPa winds from the west or northwest, which are associated with post-cold-frontal flow and disproportionately small precipitation rates in low-elevation valley locations, where the COOP stations are primarily located. This atmospheric circulation leads to a stronger than normal valley-to-mountain precipitation gradient and underestimation of actual mountain precipitation. Because of the small average number of storms (,10) reaching California each year, these individual storm misses can lead to large biases (;20\%) in total water-year precipitation and thereby significantly affect estimates of statewide water resources.},

The maneuver is then repeatedly performed with the vehicle. At each iteration the state error at the end of the primitive is used to update the maneuver parameters via a gradient adjustment.

  abstract = {Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction, estimation, and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.}

Superconducting qubits present the additional requirement that pulses must have simple parameterizations, so they can be further calibrated in the experiment, to compensate for uncertainties in system parameters. Other quantum technologies, such as sensing, require extremely high fidelities. We present a novel, conceptually simple and easy-to-implement gradient-based optimal control technique named gradient optimization of analytic controls (GOAT), which satisfies all the above requirements, unlike previous approaches. To demonstrate GOAT's capabilities, with emphasis on flexibility and ease of subsequent calibration, we optimize fast coherence-limited pulses for two leading superconducting qubits architectures---flux-tunable transmons and fixed-frequency transmons with tunable couplers.},

Interestingly, updating the regularization parameter as processing data continuously in time is a desirable strategy to improve performance in applications such as beamforming. While many of the presented works in the literature assume non-time-varying regularized RLS (RRLS) techniques, this paper deals with a time-varying RRLS as the parameter varies during the update. The paper proposes a novel and efficient technique that uses an approximate recursive formula, assuming a slight variation in the regularization parameter to provide a low-complexity update method. Simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the derived formula and the superiority of the time-varying RRLS strategy over the fixed one.},

  abstract = {Deployment of multi-plane satellite constellations has become a fresh challenge in the space program missions since all the direct solutions including plane changing maneuvers and separate launches are energy and time-consuming. A proposed solution to this challenge is launching several satellites simultaneously and deploying them using gravitational perturbations of the Earth. Utilizing this solutions, only in-plane satellite maneuvers are sufficient to deploy a constellation of satellites in several orbital planes. The aim of this study is to extend and develop the present methods that use the concept of nodal precession to deploy a multi-plane satellite constellation with only one launch in order to cover a wider range of mission specifications, provide mathematical expressions for the total deployment time and the fuel expenditure of these methods, optimize the methods multi-objectively and provide a thorough analysis and comparison between them. Two general methods are proposed in this study; one that places all the satellites in a parking orbit and injects them into their final orbits sequentially, and one that first places them in different drifting orbits and after a certain amount of time, maneuvers them to their final orbits. The findings of the optimization process suggest that the method which involves all the satellites in the process of deployment simultaneously and by this means exploits the full nodal precessing potential of all of them provides better results in comparison with the method with a more passive approach, which considers the deployment a sequential process. Finally, since this mathematical modeling is performed for the first time in the literature, the mathematical expressions for both methods are analyzed to provide beneficial insights for the designers.},

Our certificates of invariance are given in terms of sums of squares proofs of a set of appropriately defined Lyapunov inequalities. These certificates, together with our proposed polynomial controllers, can be efficiently obtained via semidefinite optimization. Our approach can handle time-varying dynamics resulting from tracking a given trajectory, input saturations (e.g. torque limits), and can be extended to deal with uncertainty in the dynamics and state. The resulting controllers can be used by space-filling feedback motion planning algorithms to fill up the space with significantly fewer trajectories. We demonstrate our approach on a severely torque limited underactuated double pendulum (Acrobot) and provide extensive simulation and hardware validation.},

Despite the wide acceptance of SOS programming in the control and optimization communities, scalability has been a key challenge due to its reliance on semidefinite programming (SDP) as its main computational engine. While SDPs have many appealing features, current SDP solvers do not approach the scalability or numerical maturity of LP and SOCP solvers. Our approach is based on the recent work of Ahmadi and Majumdar [1], which replaces the positive semidefiniteness constraint inherent in the SOS approach with stronger conditions based on diagonal dominance and scaled diagonal dominance. This leads to the DSOS and SDSOS cones of polynomials, which can be optimized over using LP and SOCP respectively. We demonstrate this approach on four high dimensional control problems that are currently well beyond the reach of SOS programming: computing a region of attraction for a 22 dimensional system, analysis of a 50 node network of oscillators, searching for degree 3 controllers and degree 8 Lyapunov functions for an Acrobot system (with the resulting controller validated on a hardware platform), and a balancing controller for a 30 state and 14 control input model of the ATLAS humanoid robot. While there is additional conservatism introduced by our approach, extensive numerical experiments on smaller instances of our problems demonstrate that this conservatism can be small compared to SOS programming.},

Furthermore, we consider scenarios where these plans must be generated in real-time, because constraints such as obstacles in the environment may not be known until they are perceived (with a noisy sensor) at runtime. Our approach is to pre-compute a library of ``funnels'' along different maneuvers of the system that the state is guaranteed to remain within (despite bounded disturbances) when the feedback controller corresponding to the maneuver is executed. We leverage powerful computational machinery from convex optimization (sums-of-squares programming in particular) to compute these funnels. The resulting funnel library is then used to sequentially compose motion plans at runtime while ensuring the safety of the robot. A major advantage of the work presented here is that by explicitly taking into account the effect of uncertainty, the robot can evaluate motion plans based on how vulnerable they are to disturbances.},

The crucial technological barrier is to package force sensor and communication function in a small volume. In this paper, we propose the novel device structure based on a wafer bonding technology to integrate and package capacitive force sensor using silicon diaphragm and an integrated circuit separately manufactured. Unique fabrication processes are developed, such as the feed-through forming using a dicing process, a planarization of the Benzocyclobutene (BCB) polymer filled in the feed-through and a wafer bonding to stack silicon diaphragm onto ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) wafer. The ASIC used in this paper has a capacitance measurement circuit and a digital communication interface mimicking a tactile receptor of a human. We successfully integrated the force sensor and the ASIC into a 2.5{\texttimes}2.5{\texttimes}0.3 mm die and confirmed autonomously transmitted packets which contain digital sensing data with the linear force sensitivity of 57,640 Hz/N and 10 mN of data fluctuation. A small stray capacitance of 1.33 pF is achieved by use of 10 {$\mu$}m thick BCB isolation layer and this minimum package structure.},

Here we seek to address this question with a semi-analytic framework for calculating the post-coronagraph contrast in a closed-loop AO system. We do this starting with the temporal power spectra of the Fourier basis calculated assuming frozen flow turbulence, and then apply closed-loop transfer functions. We include the benefits of a simple predictive controller, which we show could provide over a factor of 1400 gain in raw PSF contrast at 1 \${\textbackslash}lambda/D\$ on bright stars, and more than a factor of 30 gain on an I = 7.5 mag star such as Proxima. More sophisticated predictive control can be expected to improve this even further. Assuming a photon noise limited observing technique such as High Dispersion Coronagraphy, these gains in raw contrast will decrease integration times by the same large factors. Predictive control of atmospheric turbulence should therefore be seen as one of the key technologies which will enable ground-based telescopes to characterize terrrestrial planets.},

  abstract = {Reliable and efficient trajectory generation methods are a fundamental need for autonomous dynamical systems of tomorrow. The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive tutorial of three major convex optimization-based trajectory generation methods: lossless convexification (LCvx), and two sequential convex programming algorithms known as SCvx and GuSTO. In this article, trajectory generation is the computation of a dynamically feasible state and control signal that satisfies a set of constraints while optimizing key mission objectives. The trajectory generation problem is almost always nonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient and reliable solution onboard an autonomous vehicle. The three algorithms that we discuss use problem reformulation and a systematic algorithmic strategy to nonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory generation tasks through the use of a convex optimizer. The theoretical guarantees and computational speed offered by convex optimization have made the algorithms popular in both research and industry circles. To date, the list of applications includes rocket landing, spacecraft hypersonic reentry, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, aerial motion planning for fixed-wing and quadrotor vehicles, robot motion planning, and more. Among these applications are high-profile rocket flights conducted by organizations like NASA, Masten Space Systems, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. This article aims to give the reader the tools and understanding necessary to work with each algorithm, and to know what each method can and cannot do. A publicly available source code repository supports the provided numerical examples. By the end of the article, the reader should be ready to use the methods, to extend them, and to contribute to their many exciting modern applications.},

  abstract = {Space mission design places a premium on cost and operational efficiency. The search for new science and life beyond Earth calls for spacecraft that can deliver scientific payloads to geologically rich yet hazardous landing sites. At the same time, the last four decades of optimization research have put a suite of powerful optimization tools at the fingertips of the controls engineer. As we enter the new decade, optimization theory, algorithms, and software tooling have reached a critical mass to start seeing serious application in space vehicle guidance and control systems. This survey paper provides a detailed overview of recent advances, successes, and promising directions for optimization-based space vehicle control. The considered applications include planetary landing, rendezvous and proximity operations, small body landing, constrained attitude reorientation, endo-atmospheric flight including ascent and reentry, and orbit transfer and injection. The primary focus is on the last ten years of progress, which have seen a veritable rise in the number of applications using three core technologies: lossless convexification, sequential convex programming, and model predictive control. The reader will come away with a well-rounded understanding of the state-of-the-art in each space vehicle control application, and will be well positioned to tackle important current open problems using convex optimization as a core technology.},

  abstract = {Reduced plantar sensation secondary to chronic diffuse polyneuropathy (PN) is believed to reduce locomotor stability, especially when walking at non-preferred speeds. However, the contribution of plantar sensation to the maintenance of locomotor stability is not entirely clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute loss of plantar sensation on the stability-related kinematic properties of walking at different speeds. Lower-extremity joint kinematics were acquired as healthy young adults walked on a treadmill at their preferred walking speed (PWS) and three predetermined speeds (0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 m/s) under both normal and desensitized conditions. Desensitization of the foot soles was induced by ice-exposure, and plantar pressure sensation was assessed by a 5.07 monofilament. The average magnitude of stride duration variability (SDvar) and lower-extremity joint angle variability (JTvar), as well as shortand long-term ``finite-time'' Lyapunov exponents (kS{\~A}T, k{\~A}LT) associated with lower-extremity joint angles were computed. Ice-induced plantar desensitization led to increased kS{\~A}T (\$40\%) and k{\~A}LT (\$8\%) values but did not affect SDvar or JTvar. Higher treadmill speed led to greater k{\~A}ST and k{\~A}LT values, but the speed effects were not influenced by plantar desensitization.While acute loss of plantar sensation does not appear to influence the magnitude of spatial or temporal variability, it did attenuate the state-space trajectory divergence caused by stride-to-stride variability (i.e., kS{\~A}T and kL{\~A} T). However, as opposed to walking at PWS, otherwise healthy locomotor systems do not appear to place increased reliance on plantar sensation when walking at non-preferred treadmill speeds.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the SCvx algorithm, a successive convexification algorithm designed to solve non-convex constrained optimal control problems with global convergence and superlinear convergence-rate guarantees. The proposed algorithm can handle nonlinear dynamics and non-convex state and control constraints. It solves the original problem to optimality by successively linearizing non-convex dynamics and constraints about the solution of the previous iteration. The resulting convex subproblems are numerically tractable, and can be computed quickly and reliably using convex optimization solvers, making the SCvx algorithm well suited for real-time applications. Analysis is presented to show that the algorithm converges both globally and superlinearly, guaranteeing i) local optimality recovery: if the converged solution is feasible with respect to the original problem, then it is also a local optimum; ii) strong convergence: if the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality holds at the converged solution, then the solution is unique. The superlinear rate of convergence is obtained by exploiting the structure of optimal control problems, showcasing that faster rate of convergence can be achieved by leveraging specific problem properties when compared to generic nonlinear programming methods. Numerical simulations are performed for a non-convex quad-rotor motion planning problem, and corresponding results obtained using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and general purpose Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers are provided for comparison. The results show that the convergence rate of the SCvx algorithm is indeed superlinear, and that SCvx outperforms the other two methods by converging in less number of iterations.},

  abstract = {Given a graph, the shortest-path problem requires finding a sequence of edges with minimum cumulative length that connects a source vertex to a target vertex. We consider a variant of this classical problem in which the position of each vertex in the graph is a continuous decision variable constrained in a convex set, and the length of an edge is a convex function of the position of its endpoints. Problems of this form arise naturally in many areas, from motion planning of autonomous vehicles to optimal control of hybrid systems. The price for such a wide applicability is the complexity of this problem, which is easily seen to be NP-hard. Our main contribution is a strong and lightweight mixed-integer convex formulation based on perspective operators, that makes it possible to efficiently find globally optimal paths in large graphs and in high-dimensional spaces.},

  abstract = {The behavioral approach to systems theory, put forward 40 years ago by Jan C. Willems, takes a representationfree perspective of a dynamical system as a set of trajectories. Till recently, it was an unorthodox niche of research but has gained renewed interest for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm, for which it is uniquely suited due to the representation-free perspective paired with recently developed computational methods. A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspace-type data-driven methods. The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a non-parametric representation of a linear time-invariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data. This paper reviews the fundamental lemma, its generalizations, and related data-driven analysis, signal processing, and control methods. A prototypical signal processing problem, reviewed in the paper, is missing data estimation. It includes simulation, state estimation, and output tracking control as special cases. The direct data-driven control methods using the fundamental lemma and the non-parametric representation are loosely classified as implicit and explicit approaches. Representative examples are data-enabled predictive control (an implicit method) and data-driven linear quadratic regulation (an explicit method). These methods are equally amenable to certainty-equivalence as well as to robust control. Emphasis is put on the robustness of the methods under noise. The methods allow for theoretical certification, they are computationally tractable, in comparison with machine learning methods require small amount of data, and are robustly implementable in real-time on complex physical systems.},

The current implementation targets problem families that can be transformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convex quadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat, library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. The generated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictable run-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static and dynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computation yields reliable performance, even with poor quality data. In this paper we describe how CVXGEN is implemented, and give some results on the speed and reliability of the automatically generated solvers.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

The purpose of this paper is to show how this successful procedure may be extended to provide robust model predictive control of constrained nonlinear systems.

The aim of this paper is to clarify the nature of this optimality condition, which we call the firstorder minimax condition, and of a related integrated form of the condition, which, also, is implicit in past algorithm convergence analysis. We consider these conditions, separately, when a pathwise state constraint is, and is not, included in the problem formulation. When there are no pathwise state constraints, we show that the integrated firstorder minimax condition is equivalent to the minimum principle and that the minimum principle (and equivalent integrated first-order minimax condition) is strictly stronger than the first-order minimax condition. For problems with state constraints, we establish that the integrated first-order minimax condition and the minimum principle are, once again, equivalent. But, in the state constrained context, it is no longer the case that the minimum principle is stronger than the first-order minimax condition, or vice versa. An example confirms the perhaps surprising fact that the first-order minimax condition is a distinct optimality condition that can provide information, for problems with state constraints, in some circumstances when the minimum principle fails to do so.},

Unfortunately, the convergence rate of these solvers is significantly affected by the conditioning of the problem data, with illconditioned problems requiring a large number of iterations. To reduce the number of iterations required, we present a simple method for computing a horizon-independent preconditioning matrix for the Hessian of the condensed problem. The preconditioner is based on the block Toeplitz structure of the Hessian. Horizonindependence allows one to use only the predicted system and cost matrices to compute the preconditioner, instead of the full Hessian. The proposed preconditioner has equivalent performance to an optimal preconditioner in numerical examples, producing speedups between 2x and 9x for the Fast Gradient Method. Additionally, we derive horizon-independent spectral bounds for the Hessian in terms of the transfer function of the predicted system, and show how these can be used to compute a novel horizonindependent bound on the condition number for the preconditioned Hessian.},

In this work, we propose a nonlinear MPC framework, the BiConMP which can generate whole body trajectories online by efficiently exploiting the structure of the robot dynamics. BiConMP is used to generate various cyclic gaits on a real quadruped robot and its performance is evaluated on different terrain, countering unforeseen pushes and transitioning online between different gaits. Further, the ability of BiConMP to generate non-trivial acyclic whole-body dynamic motions on the robot is presented. Finally, an extensive empirical analysis on the effects of planning horizon and frequency on the nonlinear MPC framework is reported and discussed.}

We formulate certaintyequivalent expectation-maximization as block coordinate-ascent, and provide an efficient implementation. The algorithm is tested on a simulated system of coupled Lorenz attractors, demonstrating its ability to identify high-dimensional systems that can be intractable for particle-based approaches. Our approach is also used to identify the dynamics of an aerobatic helicopter. By augmenting the state with unobserved fluid states, a model is learned that predicts the acceleration of the helicopter better than state-of-the-art approaches.

Despite success in structured, on-road settings, current end-to-end approaches for scene prediction have yet to be successfully adapted for complex outdoor terrain. To this end, we present TerrainNet, a vision-based terrain perception system for semantic and geometric terrain prediction for aggressive, off-road navigation. The approach relies on several key insights and practical considerations for achieving reliable terrain modeling. The network includes a multi-headed output representation to capture fine- and coarse-grained terrain features necessary for estimating traversability. Accurate depth estimation is achieved using self-supervised depth completion with multi-view RGB and stereo inputs. Requirements for real-time performance and fast inference speeds are met using efficient, learned image feature projections. Furthermore, the model is trained on a large-scale, real-world off-road dataset collected across a variety of diverse outdoor environments. We show how TerrainNet can also be used for costmap prediction and provide a detailed framework for integration into a planning module. We demonstrate the performance of TerrainNet through extensive comparison to current state-of-the-art baselines for camera-only scene prediction. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of integrating TerrainNet within a complete autonomous-driving stack by conducting a real-world vehicle test in a challenging off-road scenario.},

These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. [1] proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state-estimation. This was extended to parameterestimation by Wan and van der Merwe [2, 3]. The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of {\c C} {\"A} 1 for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameterestimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an {\c C} {\"A} implementation. This paper introduces the squareroot unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also {\c C} {\"A} for general state-estimation and {\c C} {\"A} for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was {\c C} {\"A}). In addition, the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances. 1.},

In case of any changes in the environment, slow re-planning is required. We propose a TAMP algorithm that optimizes over Cartesian frames defined relative to target objects. The resulting plan then remains valid even if the objects are moving and can be executed by reactive controllers that adapt to these changes in real time.

  abstract = {Legged robots that can operate autonomously in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into underexplored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: Perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, using exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. In addition, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here, we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end to end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers.},

This method, ``Expectation Propagation,'' unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.},

It offers a modular design to easily and efficiently create robotic environments with photo-realistic scenes and fast and accurate rigid and deformable body simulation. With ORBIT, we provide a suite of benchmark tasks of varying difficulty -- from single-stage cabinet opening and cloth folding to multi-stage tasks such as room reorganization. To support working with diverse observations and action spaces, we include fixed-arm and mobile manipulators with different physically-based sensors and motion generators. ORBIT allows training reinforcement learning policies and collecting large demonstration datasets from hand-crafted or expert solutions in a matter of minutes by leveraging GPU-based parallelization. In summary, we offer an open-sourced framework that readily comes with 16 robotic platforms, 4 sensor modalities, 10 motion generators, more than 20 benchmark tasks, and wrappers to 4 learning libraries. With this framework, we aim to support various research areas, including representation learning, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and task and motion planning. We hope it helps establish interdisciplinary collaborations in these communities, and its modularity makes it easily extensible for more tasks and applications in the future.

It has often been tackled as a computational geometry problem, with the Gilbert, Johnson and Keerthi (GJK) algorithm being the most common approach today. In this work we leverage the fact that collision detection is fundamentally a convex optimization problem. In particular, we establish that the GJK algorithm is a specific sub-case of the well-established Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm in convex optimization. We introduce a new collision detection algorithm by adapting recent works linking Nesterov acceleration and Frank-Wolfe methods. We benchmark the proposed accelerated collision detection method on two datasets composed of strictly convex and non-strictly convex shapes. Our results show that our approach significantly reduces the number of iterations to solve collision detection problems compared to the state-of-the-art GJK algorithm, leading to up to two times faster computation times.},

While the seminal works on the topic date back to the 80s, it is only recently that the question of properly differentiating collision detection has emerged as a central issue, thanks notably to the ongoing and various efforts made by the scientific community around the topic of differentiable physics. Yet, very few solutions have been suggested so far, and only with a strong assumption on the nature of the shapes involved. In this work, we introduce a generic and efficient approach to compute the derivatives of collision detection for any pair of convex shapes, by notably leveraging randomized smoothing techniques which have shown to be particularly adapted to capture the derivatives of non-smooth problems. This approach is implemented in the HPP-FCL and Pinocchio ecosystems, and evaluated on classic datasets and problems of the robotics literature, demonstrating few micro-second timings to compute informative derivatives directly exploitable by many real robotic applications including differentiable simulation.},

One remarkable example is a bird exploiting post-stall pressure drag in order to rapidly decelerate to land on a perch. Stall is typically associated with a loss of control authority, and it is tempting to attribute this agility of birds to the intricate morphology of the wings and tail, to their precision sensing apparatus, or their ability to perform thrust vectoring. Here we ask whether an extremely simple fixed-wing glider (no propeller) with only a single actuator in the tail is capable of landing precisely on a perch from a large range of initial conditions. To answer this question, we focus on the design of the flight control system; building upon previous work which used linear feedback control design based on quadratic regulators (LQR), we develop nonlinear feedback control based on nonlinear modelpredictive control and `LQR-Trees'. Through simulation using a flat-plate model of the glider, we find that both nonlinear methods are capable of achieving an accurate bird-like perching maneuver from a large range of initial conditions; the `LQR-Trees' algorithm is particularly useful due to its low computational burden at runtime and its inherent performance guarantees. With this in mind, we then implement the `LQR-Trees' algorithm on real hardware and demonstrate a 95 percent perching success rate over 147 flights for a wide range of initial speeds. These results suggest that, at least in the absence of significant disturbances like wind gusts, complex wing morphology and sensing are not strictly required to achieve accurate and robust perching even in the post-stall flow regime.},

In this paper, with the goal of improving the performance exhibited by RL algorithms, we explore a systematic way of leveraging the additional information provided by an emerging class of differentiable simulators. Building on concepts established by Deterministic Policy Gradients (DPG) methods, the neural network policies learned with our approach represent deterministic actions. In a departure from standard methodologies, however, learning these policies does not hinge on approximations of the value function that must be learned concurrently in an actor-critic fashion. Instead, we exploit differentiable simulators to directly compute the analytic gradient of a policy's value function with respect to the actions it outputs. This, in turn, allows us to efficiently perform locally optimal policy improvement iterations. Compared against other state-of-the-art RL methods, we show that with minimal hyper-parameter tuning our approach consistently leads to better asymptotic behavior across a set of payload manipulation tasks that demand a high degree of accuracy and precision.},

Results also show that the simulated biped robot can successfully walk with unknown disturbances that cause controllers generated by standard differential dynamic programming and the hand-tuned PD servo to fail. Learning to compensate for modeling error and previously unknown disturbances in conjunction with robust control design is also demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The Iridium Catalysed Electrolysis (ICE) thruster concept addresses the growing need for a microscale chemical propulsion system which can cater for the stringent power, propellant and integration requirements of smallsat platforms. In-situ H2/O2 propellant production via water electrolysis is highly suitable for secondary payload satellites especially when direct feed from electrolysers eliminates any requirement for gas phase storage. Two bi-propellant thruster architectures are presented with a common design and fabrication approach but highly disparate design thrust levels of 4.5 mN (ICE-Cube) and 0.7-1.7 N (ICE-200) which each address identified operational and efficiency drawbacks of current electrolysis system architectures.  A MEMS-based fabrication approach has been developed and applied in the realisation of each  thruster. This includes the qualification of several novel processes, including bulk reactive ion etching of tungsten to etch depths exceeding 500 {\textmu}m and sputter deposition of iridium onto refractory metal and silicon substrates to serve as an ignition catalyst. This experimentally qualified fabrication process has enabled the realisation of a fully regeneratively cooled thruster chip with a throat width as small as 13 {\textmu}m and presents an inherently scalable means of  manufacturing high-performance, low unit cost chemical thrusters.  A representative experimental performance evaluation was carried out on both thrusters supporting the feasibility of the concepts. Cold flow testing demonstrated exceptional Isp efficiencies in both fabricated micronozzles, exceeding 0.93 {\textpm} 0.05 for ICE-200 and 0.89 {\textpm} 0.08 for ICE-Cube. Hot fire testing provided a representative operational demonstration, with ICE-200 achieving an Isp range between 298.7-388.6 s {\textpm} 33.2 s over short duration firing periods  and ICE-Cube demonstrating prolonged firing periods exceeding 200 s and an achieved Isp between 181.2-185.4 s {\textpm} 32.4 s. This initial performance characterisation has allowed the feasible envelope of microscale electrolysis and bi-propellant thrusters to be widened and provides a validated methodology applicable to design, fabrication and test of these systems.},

Linear covariance analysis techniques are used to evaluate nominal attitude determination performance, the effects of sensor measurement accuracy variations, the effects of errors in knowledge of sensor measurement accuracy, and the effects of star tracker misalignment errors.

  abstract = {Distributed Space Missions such as formation flight and constellations, are being recognized as important Earth Observation solutions to increase measurement samples over space and time. Cubesats are increasing in size (27U, \$40 kg in development) with increasing capabilities to host imager payloads. Given the precise attitude control systems emerging in the commercial market, Cubesats now have the ability to slew and capture images within short notice. We propose a modular framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control and scheduling optimization to plan the time-varying, full-body orientation of agile Cubesats in a constellation such that they maximize the number of observed images and observation time, within the constraints of Cubesat hardware specifications. The attitude control strategy combines bang-bang and PD control, with constraints such as power consumption, response time, and stability factored into the optimality computations and a possible extension to PID control to account for disturbances. Schedule optimization is performed using dynamic programming with two levels of heuristics, verified and improved upon using mixed integer linear programming. The automated scheduler is expected to run on ground station resources and the resultant schedules uplinked to the satellites for execution, however it can be adapted for onboard scheduling, contingent on Cubesat hardware and software upgrades. The framework is generalizable over small steerable spacecraft, sensor specifications, imaging objectives and regions of interest, and is demonstrated using multiple 20 kg satellites in Low Earth Orbit for two case studies -- rapid imaging of Landsat's land and coastal images and extended imaging of global, warm water coral reefs. The proposed algorithm captures up to 161\% more Landsat images than nadir-pointing sensors with the same field of view, on a 2-satellite constellation over a 12-h simulation. Integer programming was able to verify that optimality of the dynamic programming solution for single satellites was within 10\%, and find up to 5\% more optimal solutions. The optimality gap for constellations was found to be 22\% at worst, but the dynamic programming schedules were found at nearly four orders of magnitude better computational speed than integer programming. The algorithm can include cloud cover predictions, ground downlink windows or any other spatial, temporal or angular constraints into the orbital module and be integrated into planning tools for agile constellations.},

In the design of optimal inputs, or probing signals, for parameter estimation it is more natural to consider functions of the Fisher information matrix instead. The input which maximizes the Fisher information measure for efficient estimation of a scalar parameter also provides the minimum error variance. The information is thus a logical choice for the optimality criterion in scalar problems. No such obvious choice is apparent for vector parameter estimation, however. In this paper we examine and compare a number of performance measures and select a useful criterion. The design of an optimal probing signal using this criterion is shown to be equivalent to an optimal control problem in which certain equality constraints must be satisfied. This problem may be solved by conventional techniques of deterministic or stochastic optimal control.},

  abstract = {Learning-based methods in robotics hold the promise of generalization, but what can be done if a learned policy does not generalize to a new situation? In principle, if an agent can at least evaluate its own success (i.e., with a reward classifier that generalizes well even when the policy does not), it could actively practice the task and finetune the policy in this situation. We study this problem in the setting of industrial insertion tasks, such as inserting connectors in sockets and setting screws. Existing algorithms rely on precise localization of the connector or socket and carefully managed physical setups, such as assembly lines, to succeed at the task. But in unstructured environments such as homes or even some industrial settings, robots cannot rely on precise localization and may be tasked with previously unseen connectors. Offline reinforcement learning on a variety of connector insertion tasks is a potential solution, but what if the robot is tasked with inserting previously unseen connector? In such a scenario, we will still need methods that can robustly solve such tasks with online practice. One of the main observations we make in this work is that, with a suitable representation learning and domain generalization approach, it can be significantly easier for the reward function to generalize to a new but structurally similar task (e.g., inserting a new type of connector) than for the policy. This means that a learned reward function can be used to facilitate the finetuning of the robot's policy in situations where the policy fails to generalize in zero shot, but the reward function generalizes successfully. We show that such an approach can be instantiated in the real world, pretrained on 50 different connectors, and successfully finetuned to new connectors via the learned reward function.

  abstract = {In this work, a predictive control framework is presented for feedback stabilization of nonlinear systems. To achieve this, we integrate Koopman operator theory with Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC). The main idea is to transform nonlinear dynamics from state-space to function space using Koopman eigenfunctions-for control affine systems this results in a bilinear model in the (lifted) function space. Then, a predictive controller is formulated in Koopman eigenfunction coordinates which uses an auxiliary Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) based bounded controller as a constraint to ensure stability of the Koopman system in the function space. Provided there exists a continuously differentiable inverse mapping between the original state-space and (lifted) function space, we show that the designed controller is capable of translating the feedback stabiliz-ability of the Koopman bilinear system to the original nonlinear system. Remarkably, the feedback control design proposed in this work remains completely data-driven and does not require any explicit knowledge of the original system. Furthermore, due to the bilinear structure of the Koopman model, seeking a CLF is no longer a bottleneck for LMPC. Benchmark numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the proposed feedback control design.},

  abstract = {Micro- and nano-sensors lie at the heart of critical innovation in fields ranging from medical to environmental sciences. In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in sensor design along with the advances in micro- and nano-fabrication technology and the use of newly designed materials, leading to the development of high-performance gas sensors. Advanced micro- and nano-fabrication technology enables miniaturization of these sensors into micro-sized gas sensor arrays while maintaining the sensing performance. These capabilities facilitate the development of miniaturized integrated gas sensor arrays that enhance both sensor sensitivity and selectivity towards various analytes. In the past, several micro- and nano-gas sensors have been proposed and investigated where each type of sensor exhibits various advantages and limitations in sensing resolution, operating power, response, and recovery time. This paper presents an overview of the recent progress made in a wide range of gas-sensing technology. The sensing functionalizing materials, the advanced micro-machining fabrication methods, as well as their constraints on the sensor design, are discussed. The sensors' working mechanisms and their structures and configurations are reviewed. Finally, the future development outlook and the potential applications made feasible by each category of the sensors are discussed.}

  abstract = {In Model Predictive Control (MPC) the control signal is computed by solving a constrained finite-time optimal control (CFTOC) problem at each sample in the control loop. The CFTOC problem can be solved by, e.g., interior-point or active-set methods, where the main computational effort in both methods is known to be the computation of the search direction, i.e., the Newton step. This is often done using generic sparsity exploiting algorithms or serial Riccati recursions, but as parallel hardware is becoming more commonly available the need for parallel algorithms for computing the Newton step is increasing. In this paper a tailored, non-iterative parallel algorithm for computing the Newton step using the Riccati recursion is presented. The algorithm exploits the special structure of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system for a CFTOC problem. As a result it is possible to obtain logarithmic complexity growth in the prediction horizon length, which can be used to reduce the computation time for popular state-of-the-art MPC algorithms when applied to what is today considered as challenging control problems.},

Our approach is based on the perturbation theory of differential equations and extends sequential action control to stochastic dynamics. The resulting algorithm, which we name SACBP, does not require discretization of spaces or time and synthesizes control signals in near real-time. SACBP is an anytime algorithm that can handle general parametric Bayesian filters under certain assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an active sensing scenario and a model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning problem. In these challenging problems, we show that the algorithm significantly outperforms other existing solution techniques including approximate dynamic programming and local trajectory optimization.},

  abstract = {Objective. Purpose was (a) to quantify changes that occur in plantar pressure following attenuation of sensory input from the plantar surface of the foot, and (b) to quantify the resultant changes in motor output as measured by the changes of muscular activation. Design. Cross-sectional design in a laboratory setting. Background. The importance of aerent feedback to controlling gait has been demonstrated in quasi-static situations, and with animal models. However, the eects and functional signi{\textregistered}cance of sensory feedback from cutaneous receptors in the plantar surface of the foot during walking are still not resolved. Methods. Sensory thresholds were determined for the plantar surface of the foot. Sensory feedback was reduced with an ice intervention. Three altered sensory states were tested: whole foot, forefoot and rearfoot ice exposure. Plantar pressure distributions and lower extremity muscle patterns were collected while walking before and after ice exposure. Results. Exposure to ice increased vibration thresholds to low and high frequency vibrations. Peak pressure and pressure{\textpm}time integral were signi{\textregistered}cantly higher in areas of normal sensitivity and lower at the insensate areas. The center of pressure underfoot shifted away from areas of decreased sensitivity when sensory input is reduced from a portion of the foot. Muscle patterns were signi{\textregistered}cantly altered when sensory feedback was changed. Conclusions. By altering sensory feedback, one can alter gait kinetics and muscular activation patterns. Cutaneous feedback is important in the regulation and modi{\textregistered}cation of gait patterns, and sensory input needs to be included in any model that attempts to predict motion.},

  abstract = {Aims: This paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radio astronomy with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), with a focus on imaging observations. Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI) situation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz with low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a subset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed with a 0.76 kHz / 1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the low and high frequency sets to be 1.8\% and 3.2\% respectively. These values are found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of 0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5\%. This rate increases approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution. Conclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR; accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent.

  abstract = {Tactile sensors that can mechanically decouple, and therefore differentiate, various tactile inputs are highly important to properly mimic the sensing capabilities of human skin. Herein, we present an all-solution processable pressure insensitive strain sensor that utilizes the difference in structural change upon the application of pressure and tensile strain. Under the application of strain, microcracks occur within the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) network, inducing a large change in resistance with gauge factor of {$\sim$}56 at 70\% strain. On the other hand, under the application of pressure to as high as 140 kPa, negligible change in resistance is observed, which can be attributed to the pressure working primarily to close the pores, and hence minimally changing the MWCNT network conformation. Our sensor can easily be coated onto irregularly shaped three-dimensional objects (e.g., robotic hand) via spray coating, or be attached to human joints, to detect bending motion. Furthermore, our sensor can differentiate between shear stress and normal pressure, and the local strain can be spatially mapped without the use of patterned electrode array using electrical impedance tomography. These demonstrations make our sensor highly useful and important for the future development of high performance tactile sensors.},

The analysis capabilities presented in this paper include automated terrain classification, automated rock detection, digital elevation model (DEM) generation, and multi-ROI (region of interest) route planning. These analysis capabilities enable to fully utilize the vast volume of high-resolution orbiter imagery, quantitatively evaluate surface mobility requirements for each candidate site, and reject subjectivity in the comparison between sites in terms of engineering considerations. The analysis results supported the discussion in the Second Landing Site Workshop held in August 2015, which resulted in selecting eight candidate sites that will be considered in the third workshop.},

We consider three different cases: (1) a contact model that is based on complementarity constraints, (2) a smooth contact model, and our proposed method (3) a variable smooth contact model. We compare these models in simulation in terms of quality of motions discovered, physical accuracy, and computation time. In each case, optimization is initialized by setting all decision variables to zero, namely, without a meaningful initial guess. For simulations, we consider a pushing manipulation task with varying complexity for a 7 degrees-of-freedom robot arm. Our results demonstrate that the optimization based on the proposed variable smooth contact model provides a good trade-off between the physical fidelity and the quality of motions discovered at the cost of increased computation time.},

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization is a fundamental problem in robotics. While optimization of continuous control trajectories is well developed, many applications require both discrete and continuous, i.e. hybrid controls. Finding an optimal sequence of hybrid controls is challenging due to the exponential explosion of discrete control combinations. Our method, based on Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), circumvents this problem by incorporating discrete actions inside DDP: we first optimize continuous mixtures of discrete actions, and, subsequently force the mixtures into fully discrete actions. Moreover, we show how our approach can be extended to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) for trajectory planning under uncertainty. We validate the approach in a car driving problem where the robot has to switch discrete gears and in a box pushing application where the robot can switch the side of the box to push. The pose and the friction parameters of the pushed box are initially unknown and only indirectly observable.},

Our library is based on hierarchical representations and designed to perform multiple proximity queries on different model representations. The set of queries includes discrete collision detection, continuous collision detection, separation distance computation and penetration depth estimation. The input models may correspond to triangulated rigid or deformable models and articulated models. Moreover, FCL can perform probabilistic collision checking between noisy point clouds that are captured using cameras or LIDAR sensors. The main benefit of FCL lies in the fact that it provides a unified interface that can be used by various applications. Furthermore, its flexible architecture makes it easier to implement new algorithms within this framework. The runtime performance of the library is comparable to state of the art collision and proximity algorithms. We demonstrate its performance on synthetic datasets as well as motion planning and grasping computations performed using a two-armed mobile manipulation robot.},

  abstract = {An effective scheme to simulate low-speed, contact-rich manipulation tasks is to assume quasistatic physics and advance system states by solving linear complementarity problems (LCPs). However, the existing LCP-based quasistatic time-stepping scheme fails to simulate grasping---an essential motion primitive in manipulation---due to two drawbacks specific to quasistatic systems. Firstly, inputs to quasistatic systems are velocity commands instead of torques. This can lead to penetration, and thus an infeasible LCP, when two rigid bodies in contact are commanded to push against each other. Secondly, as multiple force solutions exist for a given velocity command, a grasping velocity command is not guaranteed to generate sufficient grasping forces. In this paper, we reformulate the quasistatic time-stepping scheme as an optimization problem with complementarity constraints and a quadratic objective. By minimizing the difference between actual and commanded velocities, linearized non-penetration constraints can always be satisfied. Moreover, undesirable solutions with insufficient normal forces can be removed by considering elasticity, which is modeled by comparing actual and commanded velocities. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed-integer quadratic program, which can be solved reasonably quickly for smallto-medium-sized systems. The effectiveness of the proposed reformulation is validated by simulation results of systems with different levels of complexity.},

  abstract = {The empirical success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in contact-rich manipulation leaves much to be understood from a model-based perspective, where the key difficulties are often attributed to (i) the explosion of contact modes, (ii) stiff, non-smooth contact dynamics and the resulting exploding / discontinuous gradients, and (iii) the non-convexity of the planning problem. The stochastic nature of RL addresses (i) and (ii) by effectively sampling and averaging the contact modes. On the other hand, model-based methods have tackled the same challenges by smoothing contact dynamics analytically. Our first contribution is to establish the theoretical equivalence of the two smoothing schemes for simple systems, and provide qualitative and empirical equivalence on several complex examples. In order to further alleviate (ii), our second contribution is a convex, differentiable and quasi-dynamic formulation of contact dynamics, which is amenable to both smoothing schemes, and has proven to be highly effective for contact-rich planning. Our final contribution resolves (iii), where we show that classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms can be effective in global planning when contact modes are abstracted via smoothing. Applying our method on several challenging contactrich manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that efficient modelbased motion planning can achieve results comparable to RL, but with dramatically less computation.},

Additionally, we compare two optimization methodologies frequently used to solve the transcribed problem, namely sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and interior point method (IPM). As a benchmark, we solve different motion tasks on an underactuated and nonminimal-phase ball-balancing robot with a 10-D state space and 3-D input space. Additionally, we validate the results on a simulated 3-D quadrotor.

They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical al- gorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed- form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpreta- tions of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.},

  abstract = {One of the advantages that drive nanosatellite development is the potential of multi-point observation through constellation operation. However, constellation deployment of nanosatellites has been a challenge, as thruster operations for orbit maneuver were limited due to mass, volume, and power. Recently, a de-orbiting mechanism using magnetic torquer interaction with space plasma has been introduced, so-called plasma drag. As no additional hardware nor propellant is required, plasma drag has the potential in being used as constellation deployment method. In this research, a novel constellation deployment method using plasma drag is proposed. Orbit decay rate of the satellites in a constellation is controlled using plasma drag in order to achieve a desired phase angle and phase angle rate. A simplified 1D problem is formulated for an elementary analysis of the constellation deployment time. Numerical simulations are further performed for analytical analysis assessment and sensitivity analysis. Analytical analysis and numerical simulation results both agree that the constellation deployment time is proportional to the inverse square root of magnetic moment, the square root of desired phase angle and the square root of satellite mass. CubeSats ranging from 1 to 3 U (1--3 kg nanosatellites) are examined in order to investigate the feasibility of plasma drag constellation on nanosatellite systems. The feasibility analysis results show that plasma drag constellation is feasible on CubeSats, which open up the possibility of CubeSat constellation missions.},

  abstract = {This work presents a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a training procedure to enable robust and accurate pose estimation of a noncooperative spacecraft. First, a new CNN architecture is introduced that has scored a fourth place in the recent Pose Estimation Challenge hosted by Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB) and the Advanced Concepts Team (ACT) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The proposed architecture first detects the object by regressing a 2D bounding box, then a separate network regresses the 2D locations of the known surface keypoints from an image of the target cropped around the detected Region-of-Interest (RoI). In a single-image pose estimation problem, the extracted 2D keypoints can be used in conjunction with corresponding 3D model coordinates to compute relative pose via the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. These keypoint locations have known correspondences to those in the 3D model, since the CNN is trained to predict the corners in a pre-defined order, allowing for bypassing the computationally expensive feature matching processes. This work also introduces and explores the texture randomization to train a CNN for spaceborne applications. Specifically, Neural Style Transfer (NST) is applied to randomize the texture of the spacecraft in synthetically rendered images. It is shown that using the texture-randomized images of spacecraft for training improves the network's performance on spaceborne images without exposure to them during training. It is also shown that when using the texture-randomized spacecraft images during training, regressing 3D bounding box corners leads to better performance on spaceborne images than regressing surface keypoints, as NST inevitably distorts the spacecraft's geometric features to which the surface keypoints have closer relation.},

Due to the lack of representative spaceborne images of the target object at the development stage, most algorithms are typically developed and trained on computer-generated synthetic images of the target, which causes the algorithm to overfit the features specific to the synthetic imagery. In order to promote new ideas to tackle this important problem and benchmark the robustness of different algorithms across domain gaps, SPEC2021 utilizes the next-generation spacecraft pose estimation dataset comprising images from labeled images from computer graphics and real-life sources. This article covers the dataset and competition design and analyzes the results of the competition which received submissions from 36 participating teams. Specifically, through the solutions developed by the two winning teams, this article sheds light on key components that can contribute to successfully bridging the domain gap in spaceborne computer vision applications.},

  abstract = {Breakthrough Starshot is an initiative to prove ultra-fast light-driven nanocrafts, and lay the foundations for a first launch to Alpha Centauri within the next generation. Along the way, the project could generate important supplementary benefits to solar system exploration. A number of hard engineering challenges remain to be solved before these missions can become a reality. A system model has been formulated as part of the Starshot systems engineering work. This paper presents the model and describes how it computes cost-optimal point designs. Three point designs are computed: A 0.2 c mission to Alpha Centauri, a 0.01 c solar system precursor mission, and a ground-based test facility based on a vacuum tunnel. All assume that the photon pressure from a 1.06 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m wavelength beam accelerates a circular dielectric sail. The 0.2 c point design assumes {\textbackslash}\$0.01/W lasers, {\textbackslash}\$500/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$ optics, and {\textbackslash}\$50/kWh energy storage to achieve {\textbackslash}\$8.0B capital cost for the ground-based beam director. In contrast, the energy needed to accelerate each sail costs {\textbackslash}\$6M. Beam director capital cost is minimized by a 4.1 m diameter sail that is accelerated for 9 min. The 0.01 c point design assumes {\textbackslash}\$1/W lasers, {\textbackslash}\$10k/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$ optics, and {\textbackslash}\$100/kWh energy storage to achieve {\textbackslash}\$517M capital cost for the beam director and {\textbackslash}\$8k energy cost to accelerate each 19 cm diameter sail. The ground-based test facility assumes {\textbackslash}\$100/W lasers, {\textbackslash}\$1M/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$ optics, {\textbackslash}\$500/kWh energy storage, and {\textbackslash}\$10k/m vacuum tunnel. To reach 20 km/s, fast enough to escape the solar system from Earth, takes 0.4 km of vacuum tunnel, 22 kW of lasers, and a 0.6 m diameter telescope, all of which costs {\textbackslash}\$5M. The system model predicts that, ultimately, Starshot can scale to propel probes faster than 0.9 c.},

Here, we present empirical evidence that learning an accurate model in the first place can be confounded by contact, as modern deep learning approaches are not designed to capture this non-smoothness. We isolate the effects of contact's non-smoothness by varying the mechanical stiffness of a compliant contact simulator. Even for a simple system, we find that stiffness alone dramatically degrades training processes, generalization, and data-efficiency. Our results raise serious questions about simulated testing environments which do not accurately reflect the stiffness of rigid robotic hardware. Significant additional investigation will be necessary to fully understand and mitigate these effects, and we suggest several avenues for future study.},

We consider the problem of planning in Gaussian belief spaces, which are parameterized in terms of mean states and covariances describing the uncertainty. In this work, we show that it is possible to compute locally optimal plans without including the covariance in direct trajectory optimization formulations of the problem. As a result, the dimensionality of the problem scales linearly in the state dimension instead of quadratically, as would be the case if we were to include the covariance in the optimization. We accomplish this by taking advantage of recent advances in numerical optimal control that include automatic differentiation and state of the art convex solvers. We show that the running time of each optimization step of the covariance-free trajectory optimization is O(n3T ), where n is the dimension of the state space and T is the number of time steps in the trajectory. We present experiments in simulation on a variety of planning problems under uncertainty including manipulator planning, estimating unknown model parameters for dynamical systems, and active simultaneous localization and mapping (active SLAM). Our experiments suggest that our method can solve planning problems in 100 dimensional state spaces and obtain computational speedups of 400{\texttimes} over related trajectory optimization methods.},

Since a common use of a large matrix like H is to compute its product with various vectors, we derive a technique that directly calculates Hv, where v is an arbitrary vector. This allows H to be treated as a generalized sparse matrix. To calculate Hv, we first define a differential operator R\{f(w)\} = (d/dr)f(w + rv){\textbar}\_\{r=0\}, note that R\{grad\_w\} = Hv and R\{w\} = v, and then apply R\{\} to the equations used to compute grad\_w. The result is an exact and numerically stable procedure for computing Hv, which takes about as much computation, and is about as local, as a gradient evaluation. We then apply the technique to backpropagation networks, recurrent backpropagation, and stochastic Boltzmann Machines. Finally, we show that this technique can be used at the heart of many iterative techniques for computing various properties of H, obviating the need for direct methods.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the success of the Koopman operator in dynamical systems analysis has also fueled the development of Koopman operator-based control frameworks. In order to preserve the relatively low data requirements for an approximation via dynamic mode decomposition, a quantization approach was recently proposed in [S. Peitz and S. Klus, Automatica J. IFAC, 106 (2019), pp. 184- 191]. This way, control of nonlinear dynamical systems can be realized by means of switched systems techniques, using only a finite set of autonomous Koopman operator-based reduced models. These individual systems can be approximated very efficiently from data. The main idea is to transform a control system into a set of autonomous systems for which the optimal switching sequence has to be computed. In this article, we extend these results to continuous control inputs using relaxation. This way, we combine the advantages of the data efficiency of approximating a finite set of autonomous systems with continuous controls, as the data requirements increase only linearly with the input dimension. We show that when using the Koopman generator, this relaxation-realized by linear interpolation between two operators-does not introduce any error for control affine systems. This allows us to control high-dimensional nonlinear systems using bilinear, low-dimensional surrogate models. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using several examples with increasing complexity, from the Duffing oscillator to the chaotic fluidic pinball.},

  abstract = {We tackle the problem of minimum-time flight for a quadrotor through a sequence of waypoints in the presence of obstacles while exploiting the full quadrotor dynamics. Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of the quadrotor, and, thus, resulted in suboptimal solutions. Recent works can plan minimum-time trajectories; yet, the trajectories are executed with control methods that do not account for obstacles. Thus, a successful execution of such trajectories is prone to errors due to model mismatch and inflight disturbances. To this end, we leverage deep reinforcement learning and classical topological path planning to train robust neural-network controllers for minimum-time quadrotor flight in cluttered environments. The resulting neural network controller demonstrates substantially better performance of up to 19\% over state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the learned policy solves the planning and control problem simultaneously online to account for disturbances, thus achieving much higher robustness. As such, the presented method achieves 100\% success rate of flying minimum-time policies without collision, while traditional planning and control approaches achieve only 40\%. The proposed method is validated in both simulation and the real world, with quadrotor speeds of up to 42 km h-1 and accelerations of 3.6g.},

In this formulation the issues involving boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity variables and the pressure are clearly resolved. In addition, it is shown that poor temporal accuracy (first-order) is not due to boundary conditions, but due to the method itself. A generalized block LU decomposition that overcomes this difficulty is presented, allowing arbitrarily high temporal order of accuracy. The generalized decomposition is shown to be useful for a wide range of problems including steady problems. Technical issues, such as stability and the appropriate pressure update scheme, are also addressed. Numerical simulations of the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a square domain confirm the theoretical results.}

  abstract = {This study employed manipulation of sensory inputs (vision and plantar-surface cutaneous sensation) during gait termination to elicit insight into the roles played by these sensory systems in the control of gait termination. Attenuation of cutaneous sensation was achieved through hypothermic anesthesia. Visual information was occluded using special glasses. The subjects were asked to walk along an 8 m walkway and during randomly selected trials (25\% of trials) to terminate their gait in a predetermined area. The centre of mass (COM) was obtained in order to provide an indication of the efficiency and stability during termination when sensory inputs were manipulated. Lack of visual information delayed the initiation of the slowing down of the COM forward progression and increased the step length of the last step of termination. Additionally, lack of vision resulted in the COM moving closer to the base of support (BOS) during double support and more variability, in the COM, when attempting to achieve a final stable position. Insensitivity of the plantar-surface mechanoreceptors led to a longer second step and a more variable foot placement of the first step, and increased the loading rate during the final two steps of termination. Additionally when vision and cutaneous information were absent the resolution of the final stable position was not as effectively controlled. The results demonstrated that visual information about self-motion and object-motion and sensation from the plantar surface of the foot play phase-specific roles in the control of COM during gait termination. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {A carrier phase reconstruction technique is presented as an enabler for low-power centimeter-accurate mobile positioning. Reliable carrier phase reconstruction permits the duty cycling of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver whose outputs are used for precise carrier-phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) positioning. Existing CDGNSS techniques are power intensive because they require continuous tracking of each GNSS signal's carrier phase. By contrast, the less-precise code-ranging technique that is commonly used in mobile devices for 3-to-10-meter-accurate positioning allows for aggressive measurement duty-cycling, which enables low-power implementations. The technique proposed in this paper relaxes the CDGNSS continuous phase tracking requirement by solving a mixed real and integer estimation problem to reconstruct a continuous carrier phase time history from intermittent phase measurement intervals each having an ambiguous initial phase. Theoretical bounds on the probability of successful phase reconstruction, corroborated by Monte-Carlo-type simulation, are used to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed technique to various system parameters, including the time period between successive phase measurement intervals, the duration of each interval, the carrier-to-noise ratio, and the line-of-sight acceleration uncertainty. A demonstration on real data indicates that coupling a GNSS receiver with a consumer-grade inertial measurement unit enables reliable phase reconstruction with phase measurement duty cycles as low as 5\%.},

Various parameters that affect collision severity, including interface friction, interface stiffness, end tip velocity and joint stiffness irrespective of controller bandwidth are also explored using the sensor to provide information about the contact force at the site of impact. Joint stiffness is made independent of controller bandwidth limitations using passive torsional springs of various stiffnesses.

  abstract = {We cast the partially observable control problem as a fully observable underactuated stochastic control problem in belief space and apply standard planning and control techniques. One of the difficulties of belief space planning is modeling the stochastic dynamics resulting from unknown future observations. The core of our proposal is to define deterministic beliefsystem dynamics based on an assumption that the maximum likelihood observation (calculated just prior to the observation) is always obtained. The stochastic effects of future observations are modeled as Gaussian noise. Given this model of the dynamics, two planning and control methods are applied. In the first, linear quadratic regulation (LQR) is applied to generate policies in the belief space. This approach is shown to be optimal for linearGaussian systems. In the second, a planner is used to find locally optimal plans in the belief space. We propose a replanning approach that is shown to converge to the belief space goal in a finite number of replanning steps. These approaches are characterized in the context of a simple nonlinear manipulation problem where a planar robot simultaneously locates and grasps an object.},

Unlike most approaches in the literature which rely upon representing belief state as a Gaussian distribution, we have recently proposed an approach to non-Gaussian belief space planning based on solving a non-linear optimization problem defined in terms of a set of state samples [1]. In this paper, we show that even though our approach makes optimistic assumptions about the content of future observations for planning purposes, all low-cost plans are guaranteed to gain information in a specific way under certain conditions. We show that eventually, the algorithm is guaranteed to localize the true state of the system and to reach a goal region with high probability. Although the computational complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the number of samples used to define the optimization problem, our convergence guarantee holds with as few as two samples. Moreover, we show empirically that it is unnecessary to use large numbers of samples in order to obtain good performance.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges in solving partially observable control problems is planning in high-dimensional belief spaces. Essentially, it is necessary to plan in the parameter space of all relevant probability distributions over the state space. The literature has explored different planning technologies including trajectory optimization [8, 6] and roadmap methods [12, 4]. Unfortunately, these methods are hard to use in a receding horizon control context where it is potentially necessary to replan on every time step. Trajectory optimization is not guaranteed to find globally optimal solutions and roadmap methods can have long planning times. This paper identifies a non-trivial instance of the belief space planning problem that is convex and can therefore be solved quickly and optimally even for high dimensional problems. We prove that the resulting control strategy will ultimately reach a goal region in belief space under mild assumptions. Since the space of convex belief space planning problem is somewhat limited, we extend the approach using mixed integer programming. We propose to solve the integer part of the problem in advance so that only convex problems need be solved during receding horizon control.},

  abstract = {The limited nature of robot sensors make many important robotics problems partially observable. These problems may require the system to perform complex information-gathering operations. One approach to solving these problems is to create plans in belief-space, the space of probability distributions over the under-lying state of the system. The belief-space plan encodes a strategy for performing a task while gaining information as necessary. Most approaches to belief-space planning rely upon representing belief state in a particular way (typically as a Gaussian). Unfortunately, this can lead to large errors between the assumed density representation of belief state and the true belief state. This paper proposes a new sample-based approach to belief-space planning that has fixed computational complexity while allowing arbitrary implementations of Bayes filtering to be used to track belief state. The approach is illustrated in the context of a simple example and compared to a prior approach. Then, we propose an application of the technique to an instance of the grasp synthesis problem where a robot must simultaneously localize and grasp an object given initially uncertain object parameters by planning information-gathering behavior. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the approach to be capable of actively localizing and grasping boxes that are presented to the robot in uncertain and hard-to-localize configurations.},

We first re-formulate the recursive dynamics algorithm originally given by Park et al. (1995) for open chains in terms of standard linear operators on the Lie algebra of the special Euclidean group. Using straight forward algebraic manipulations, we then recast the resulting algorithm into a set of closed-form dynamic equations. We then reformulate Featherstone's (1987) articulated body inertia algorithm using this same geometric framework, and re-derive Rodriguez et al.'s (1991, 1992) square factorization of the mass matrix and its inverse. An efficient O(n) recursive algorithm for forward dynamics is also extracted from the inverse factorization. The resulting equations lead to a succinct high-level description of robot dynamics in both joint and operational space coordinates that minimizes symbolic complexity without sacrificing computational efficiency, and provides the basis for a dynamics formulation that does not require link reference frames in the description of the forward kinematics},

The underlying goal of the mission is to image and perform photometry on bright, nearby stars and possibly detect transiting exoplanets orbiting these stars. As a technology demonstration with an eye to enable this science, the payload must be pointed with a stability of 5 arcseconds RMS over 20-minute observations and a repeatability of 1 arcsecond RMS across multiple observations. A two-stage control system was employed to achieve these pointing requirements: reaction wheels control the attitude of the spacecraft bus while a piezo stage translates the focal plane array to control the pointing of the payload. This paper will present on-orbit results that demonstrate a pointing stability of 0.5 arcsecond RMS over 20 minutes and a pointing repeatability of 1 milliarcsecond RMS from observation to observation, the best pointing of a CubeSat to date. In addition, this paper will discuss the pointing achieved by the attitude control subsystem alone, pointing issues due to temporarily bright pixels, hot pixels, and reaction wheel speed reversals or zero crossings, the deployment and Sun acquisition phase, momentum management issues arising from a large residual dipole, and some of the anomalies encountered with the attitude control subsystem.},

  abstract = {Efficient approaches to quantum control and feedback are essential for quantum technologies, from sensing to quantum computation. Pure control tasks have been successfully solved using optimization techniques, including methods like gradient-ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) , relying on a differentiable model of the quantum dynamics. For feedback tasks, such methods are not directly applicable, since the aim is to discover strategies conditioned on measurement outcomes. There, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven a powerful new ansatz. What is missing is a way to combine the best of both approaches for scenarios that go beyond weak measurements. In this work, we introduce feedback-GRAPE, which borrows concepts from model-free RL to incorporate the response to strong stochastic (discrete or continuous) measurements, while still performing direct gradient ascent through the quantum dynamics. We illustrate its power on a Jaynes-Cummings model with feedback, where it yields interpretable feedback strategies for state preparation and stabilization in the presence of noise. This approach could be employed for discovering strategies in a wide range of feedback tasks, from calibration of multi-qubit devices to linear-optics quantum computation strategies, quantum-enhanced sensing with adaptive measurements, and quantum error correction.},

These constraints define a manifold of feasible states; while well understood mathematically, they pose numerical challenges to many algorithms for planning and controlling whole-body dynamic motions. In this paper, we present an approach to the synthesis and stabilization of complex trajectories for both fully-actuated and underactuated robots subject to contact constraints. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm (DIRCON) that extends the direct collocation method, naturally incorporating manifold constraints to produce a nominal trajectory with third-order integration accuracy---a critical feature for achieving reliable tracking control. We adapt the classical time-varying linear quadratic regulator to produce a local cost-to-go in the manifold tangent plane. Finally, we descend the cost-to-go using a quadratic program that incorporates unilateral friction and torque constraints. This approach is demonstrated on three complex walking and climbing locomotion examples in simulation.},

Our framework is based on a novel metric for quality of observability that is state-estimator agnostic and offers improved numerical stability over prior methods in some cases where the states of interest do not appear directly in the observation. We apply this metric to trajectory optimization problems for closed-loop self-calibration, maintaining observability while navigating through an environment, and rapidly modifying an already-planned trajectory for online recalibration. We include a statistical procedure to balance observability of several states with heterogeneous units and magnitudes. As an example, we apply our framework to online calibration of GPS?IMU and visual?inertial navigation systems on a quadrotor helicopter. Extensive simulations and a real-robot experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing better convergence of the states and the resulting higher precision in navigation.},

For actuated systems, standard Koopman analysis and DMD are incapable of producing input-output models; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new theoretical developments extend Koopman operator theory to allow for systems with nonlinear input-output characteristics. We show how this generalization is rigorously connected to a recent development called dynamic mode decomposition with control. We demonstrate this new theory on nonlinear dynamical systems, including a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

We apply robust trajectory optimization techniques to suppress gate errors arising from system parameter uncertainty. We propose a derivative-based approach that maintains computational efficiency by using forward-mode differentiation. Additionally, the effect of depolarization on a gate is typically modeled by integrating the Lindblad master equation, which is computationally expensive. We employ a computationally efficient model and utilize time-optimal control to achieve high-fidelity gates in the presence of depolarization. We apply these techniques to a fluxonium qubit and suppress simulated gate errors due to parameter uncertainty below 10-7 for static parameter deviations of the order of 1\%.},

First, with the knowledge of norm upper bounds of external disturbances and the coupling effect of flexible modes, a novel robust fixed-time controller is designed to deal with this problem. Second, the controller is further enhanced by an adaptive law to avoid the knowledge of norm upper bounds of external disturbances and coupling effect of flexible modes. This control law guarantees the convergence of attitude tracking errors in fixed time where the settling time is bounded by a constant independent of initial conditions. Moreover, the proposed controllers can prevent the unwinding phenomenon. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract = {Live fuel moisture (LFM) is an important fuel property controlling fuel ignition and fire propagation. LFM varies seasonally, and is controlled by precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and plant physiology. LFM is typically sampled manually in the field, which leads to sparse measurements in space and time. Use of LFM proxies could reduce the need for field sampling while potentially improving spatial and temporal sampling density. This study compares soil moisture and remote sensing data to field-sampled LFM for Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt) in northern Utah. Bivariate linear regression models were constructed between LFM and four independent variables. Soil moisture was more strongly correlated with LFM than remote sensing measurements, and produced the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted LFM values at most of the sites. When sites were pooled, canopy water content (CWC) had stronger correlations with LFM than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or normalized difference water index (NDWI). MAE values for all proxies were frequently above 20 \% LFM at individual sites. Despite this relatively large error, remote sensing and soil moisture data may still be useful for improving understanding of spatial and temporal trends in LFM.},

  abstract = {DifferentialEquations.jl is a package for solving differential equations in Julia. It covers discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov) simulations), ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, algebraic differential equations, delay differential equations, hybrid differential equations, jump diffusions, and (stochastic) partial differential equations. Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.

  abstract = {The past decade has seen the rise of various radio astronomy arrays, particularly for low-frequency observations below 100MHz. These developments have been primarily driven by interesting and fundamental scientific questions, such as studying the dark ages and epoch of re-ionization, by detecting the highly red-shifted 21cm line emission. However, Earth-based radio astronomy below frequencies of 30MHz is severely restricted due to man-made interference, ionospheric distortion and almost complete non-transparency of the ionosphere below 10MHz. Therefore, this narrow spectral band remains possibly the last unexplored frequency range in radio astronomy. A straightforward solution to study the universe at these frequencies is to deploy a space-based antenna array far away from Earths' ionosphere. Various studies in the past were principally limited by technology and computing resources, however current processing and communication trends indicate otherwise. We briefly present the achievable science cases, and discuss the system design for selected scenarios, such as extra-galactic surveys. An extensive discussion is presented on various sub-systems of the potential satellite array, such as radio astronomical antenna design, the on-board signal processing, communication architectures and joint space-time estimation of the satellite network. In light of a scalable array and to avert single point of failure, we propose both centralized and distributed solutions for the ULW space-based array. We highlight the benefits of various deployment locations and summarize the technological challenges for future space-based radio arrays.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm that probabilistically covers a bounded region of the state space of a nonlinear system with a sparse tree of feedback stabilized trajectories leading to a goal state. The generated tree serves as a lookup table control policy to get any reachable initial condition within that region to the goal. The approach combines motion planning with reasoning about the set of states around a trajectory for which the feedback policy of the trajectory is able to stabilize the system. The key idea is to use a random sample from the bounded region for both motion planning and approximation of the stabilizable sets by falsification; this keeps the number of samples and simulations needed to generate covering policies reasonably low. We simulate the nonlinear system to falsify the stabilizable sets, which allows enforcing input and state constraints. Compared to the algebraic verification using sums of squares optimization in our previous work, the simulationbased approximation of the stabilizable set is less exact, but considerably easier to implement and can be applied to a broader range of nonlinear systems. We show simulation results obtained with model systems and study the performance and robustness of the generated policies.},

Different from the conventional immersed boundary method, the main feature of the present model is to accurately satisfy both governing equations and boundary conditions through velocity correction and vorticity correction procedures. The velocity correction process is performed implicitly based on the requirement that velocity at the immersed boundary interpolated from the corrected velocity field accurately satisfies the nonslip boundary condition. The vorticity correction is made through the stream function formulation rather than the vorticity transport equation. It is evaluated from the firstorder derivatives of velocity correction. Two simple and efficient ways are presented for approximation of velocity-correction derivatives. One is based on finite difference approximation, while the other is based on derivative expressions of Dirac delta function and velocity correction. It was found that both ways can work very well. The main advantage of the proposed method lies in its simple concept, easy implementation, and robustness in stability. Numerical experiments for both stationary and moving boundary problems were conducted to validate the capability and efficiency of the present method. Good agreements with available data in the literature were achieved. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

One is based on finite difference approximation, while the other is based on derivative expressions of Dirac delta function and velocity correction. It was found that both ways can work very well. The main advantage of the proposed method lies in its simple concept, easy implementation, and robustness in stability. Numerical experiments for both stationary and moving boundary problems were conducted to validate the capability and efficiency of the present method. Good agreements with available data in the literature were achieved. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To help contribute to this area of research, this paper develops a dynamic model of a continuum soft robot arm driven by cables and based upon a rigorous geometrically exact approach. The model fully investigates both dynamic interaction with a dense medium and the coupled tendon condition. The model was experimentally validated with satisfactory results, using a soft robot arm working prototype inspired by the octopus arm and capable of multibending. Experimental validation was performed for the octopus most characteristic movements: bending, reaching, and fetching. The present model can be used in the design phase as a dynamic simulation platform and to design the control strategy of a continuum robot arm moving in a dense medium.},

  abstract = {We present ForwardDiff, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed AD tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB, ForwardDiff takes advantage of just-in-time (JIT) compilation to transparently recompile AD-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics. This document is an extended abstract that has been accepted for presentation at the AD2016 7th International Conference on Algorithmic Differentiation.},

The problem involves vehicles with independent dynamics but with coupled constraints to capture required cooperative behavior. Using a recently-developed form of DMPC, each vehicle plans only for its own actions, but feasibility of the sub-problems and satisfaction of the coupling constraints are guaranteed throughout, despite the action of unknown but bounded disturbances. UAVs communicate relevant plan data to ensure that decisions are consistent across the team. Collision avoidance is used as an example of coupled constraints and the paper shows how the speed, turn rate and avoidance distance limits in the optimization should be modified in order to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. Integer programming is used to solve the non-convex problem of path-planning subject to avoidance constraints. Numerical simulations compare computation time and target arrival time under decentralized and centralized control and investigate the impact of decentralization on team performance. The results show that the computation required for DMPC is significantly lower than for its centralized counterpart and scales better with the size of the team, at the expense of only a small increase in UAV flight times.},

We investigate cold- and warm-starting strategies and provide an easily computable lower iteration bound for cold-starting and an asymptotic characterization of the bounds for warm-starting. Moreover, we characterize the set of MPC problems for which small iteration bounds and thus short solution times are expected. The theoretical findings and the practical relevance of the obtained lower iteration bounds are underpinned by various numerical examples and compared to certification results for a primal-dual interior point method.},

The observation relationships, at each step of estimation, are expressed in terms of variables of the parametric state so that the problem of determining the orbit is transferred to parametric space. Once the problem of orbit determination is formulated in terms of parametric variables, a procedure is given, making use of the sequential extended Kalman filter. It is expected that the procedure proposed will provide a gain in accuracy as well as a saving in computer work, since no numerical integration of the state is involved.},

  abstract = {Orbit determination of spacecraft in orbit has been mostly dependent on either GNSS satellite signals or ground station telemetry. Both methods present their limitations, however: GNSS signals can only be used effectively in earth orbit, and ground-based orbit determination presents an inherent latency that increases with the Earth--spacecraft distance. For spacecraft flying formations, an alternative method of orbit determination, independent of external signals, consists in the observation of the spacecraft's position with respect to the central body through the relative positioning history of the spacecraft within the formation. In this paper, the potential of the relative positioning method is demonstrated in the context of the SunRISE mission, and compared with the mission's previously proposed orbit determination methods. An optimization study is then made to find the optimal placement of a new spacecraft in the formation so as to maximize the positioning accuracy of the system. Finally, the possibility of removing part of the system's relative bearing measurements while maintaining its observability is also studied. The resulting system is found to be observable, but ill-conditioned.},

Specifically, we observe that ADMM is an inexact version of MM and approaches its performance when multiple coordination steps are performed. In addition, we use the observation that PH is a specialization of ADMM and borrow Lyapunov function and primal-dual feasibility metrics used in ADMM to explain why PH is capable of solving nonconvex NLPs. This analysis also highlights that specialized PH schemes can be derived to tackle a wider range of stochastic programs and even other problem classes.

This work presents a model that approximates the continuous shape of a continuum manipulator by a serial chain of rigid links, connected by flexible rotational joints. This rigid-link model permits a description of manipulator shape under different loading conditions. A kinematic controller, based on the manipulator Jacobian of the proposed rigid-link model, is implemented and realizes trajectory tracking, while using the kinematic redundancy of the manipulator to perform a secondary task of avoiding obstacles. The controller is evaluated on an experimental testbed, consisting of a planar tendon-driven continuum manipulator with two bending segments. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are used to reconstruct 3-D manipulator shape, and is used as feedback for closed-loop control of the manipulator. Manipulator steering is evaluated for two cases: the first case involving steering around a static obstacle and the second case involving steering along a straight path while avoiding a moving obstacle. Mean trajectory tracking errors are 0.24 and 0.09 mm with maximum errors of 1.37 and 0.52 mm for the first and second cases, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of FBG sensors to measure interaction forces, while simultaneously using them for shape sensing.},

Enhanced accuracy for the method is attained locally by covering an immersed boundary vicinity with a sequence of nested, progressively finer rectangular grid patches which dynamically follow the immersed boundary motion. The set of equations describing the interaction between a non-stationary, viscous incompressible fluid and an immersed elastic boundary is solved by coupling a projection method, specially designed for locally refined meshes, to an implicit formulation of the Immersed Boundary Method. The main contributions of this work concern the formulation and the implementation of a multilevel self-adaptive version of the Immersed Boundary Method on locally refined meshes. This approach is tested for a particular two-dimensional model problem, for which no significant difference is found between the solutions obtained on a mesh refined locally around the immersed boundary, and on the associated uniform mesh, built with the resolution of the finest level.}

  abstract = {Imitation Learning, while applied successfully on many large real-world problems, is typically addressed as a standard supervised learning problem, where it is assumed the training and testing data are i.i.d.. This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner's policy is slowly modified from executing the expert's policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.}

  abstract = {In the six years that have passed since the publication of the first edition of this book, iterative methods for linear systems have made good progress in scientific and engineering disciplines. This is due in great part to the increased complexity and size of the new generation of linear and nonlinear systems that arise from typical applications. At the same time, parallel computing has penetrated the same application areas, as inexpensive computer power has become broadly available and standard communication languages such as MPI have provided a much needed standardization. This has created an incentive to utilize iterative rather than direct solvers, because the problems solved are typically from threedimensional models for which direct solvers often become ineffective. Another incentive is that iterative methods are far easier to implement on parallel computers. Although iterative methods for linear systems have seen a significant maturation, there are still many open problems. In particular, it still cannot be stated that an arbitrary sparse linear system can be solved iteratively in an efficient way. If physical information about the problem can be exploited, more effective and robust methods can be tailored to the solutions. This strategy is exploited by multigrid methods. In addition, parallel computers necessitate different ways of approaching the problem and solution algorithms that are radically different from classical ones. Several new texts on the subject of this book have appeared since the first edition. Among these are the books by Greenbaum [154] and Meurant [208]. The exhaustive five-volume treatise by G. W. Stewart [273] is likely to become the de facto reference in numerical linear algebra in years to come. The related multigrid literature has also benefited from a few notable additions, including a new edition of the excellent Multigrid Tutorial [65] and a new title by Trottenberg et al. [285]. Most notable among the changes from the first edition is the addition of a sorely needed chapter on multigrid techniques. The chapters that have seen the biggest changes are Chapters 3, 6, 10, and 12. In most cases, the modifications were made to update the material by adding topics that have been developed recently or gained importance in the last few years. In some instances some of the older topics were removed or shortened. For example, the discussion on parallel architecture has been shortened. In the mid-1990s hypercubes and ``fat-trees'' were important topics to teach. This is no longer the case, since manufacturers have taken steps to hide the topology from the user, in the sense that communication has become much less sensitive to the underlying architecture.},

The proposed system is distinct from the conventional aerial manipulation systems (AMSs) in the sense that instead of conventional rigid-link arms a continuum robotic arm is used. Such an integration will enable the benefits of continuum arms especially in cluttered and less structured environments. Despite promising advantages, modeling and control of ACMS involve several challenges. The paper presents decoupled dynamic modeling of ACMS arm using the modified Cosserat rod theory. To deal with the problem of complexity and high level of modeling uncertainties, a robust adaptive control approach is proposed for the position control of ACMS and its stability is proven using Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated in a simulated environment.},

However, some difficulties remain to be dealt with, particularly about the implementation of fast and dynamic walking gaits, in other words anthropomorphic gaits, especially on uneven terrain. In this perspective, both concepts of center of pressure (CoP) and zero moment point (ZMP) are obviously useful. In this paper, the two concepts are strictly defined, the CoP with respect to ground-feet contact forces, the ZMP with respect to gravity plus inertia forces. Then, the coincidence of CoP and ZMP is proven, and related control aspects are examined. Finally, a virtual CoP-ZMP is defined, allowing us to extend the concept when walking on uneven terrain. This paper is a theoretical study. Experimental results are presented in a companion paper, analyzing the evolution of the ground contact forces obtained from a human walker wearing robot feet as shoes.},

Recent efforts to address the control problem using machine learning techniques are limited to simple SCA architectures. In this paper, we train a model-free reinforcement learning control policy based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for end effector path tracking on a BR2 SCA. Unlike simple SCA architectures, the BR2 SCA has the functionality to bend and rotate spatially thus leading to enhanced workspace and ability to perform complex tasks. The control policy is first validated in simulations and then implemented on a prototype BR2 with state feedback. An average tracking error less than 3 cm ({$<$}; diameter of the SCA) is reported using the proposed control policy. The efficacy of the control policy is validated for different loading conditions both in simulations and on the SCA prototype.},

  abstract = {As computer vision algorithms increase in capability, their applications in clinical systems will become more pervasive. These applications include: diagnostics, such as colonoscopy and bronchoscopy; guiding biopsies, minimally invasive interventions, and surgery; automating instrument motion; and providing image guidance using pre-operative scans. Many of these applications depend on the specific visual nature of medical scenes and require designing algorithms to perform in this environment. In this review, we provide an update to the field of camera-based tracking and scene mapping in surgery and diagnostics in medical computer vision. We begin with describing our review process, which results in a final list of 515 papers that we cover. We then give a high-level summary of the state of the art and provide relevant background for those who need tracking and mapping for their clinical applications. After which, we review datasets provided in the field and the clinical needs that motivate their design. Then, we delve into the algorithmic side, and summarize recent developments. This summary should be especially useful for algorithm designers and to those looking to understand the capability of off-the-shelf methods. We maintain focus on algorithms for deformable environments while also reviewing the essential building blocks in rigid tracking and mapping since there is a large amount of crossover in methods. With the field summarized, we discuss the current state of the tracking and mapping methods along with needs for future algorithms, needs for quantification, and the viability of clinical applications. We then provide some research directions and questions. We conclude that new methods need to be designed or combined to support clinical applications in deformable environments, and more focus needs to be put into collecting datasets for training and evaluation.},

  abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory entry capsule is used as an example to demonstrate how a blunt body of revolution must be treated as asymmetric in some respects when flying at a non-zero trim angle of attack. A brief description of the axisymmetric moment equations are provided before solving a system of equations describing the lateral-directional moment equations for a blunt body trimming at an angle of attack. Simplifying assumptions are made which allow the solution to the equations to be rearranged to relate the roll and yaw stability with sideslip angle to the frequency of oscillation of the vehicle body rates. The equations show that for a blunt body the roll and yaw rates are in phase and proportional to each other. The ratio of the rates is determined by the static stability coefficients and mass properties about those axes. A trajectory simulation is used to validate the static yaw stability parameter identification equation and a simple method of identifying the oscillation frequency from the body rates. The approach is shown to successfully extract the modeled yaw stability coefficient along a simulated Mars entry. Mars Science Laboratory flight data results are presented from earlier work which indicate that results from both the validation case and flight data are in agreement with preflight predictions. A brief discussion of the dynamic stability is also provided. Trimming at a nonzero angle suggests that the typical axisymmetric models of the dynamic stability coefficients should be modified. However, further experimental or computational work must be done to separate damping due to body rates and wind relative rates before the correct lifting formulation would affect simulation results.},

Given a desired trajectory to be followed, the proposed learning algorithm improves the system performance from trial to trial by exploiting the experience gained from previous repetitions. Taking advantage of the a-priori knowledge about the systems dominating dynamics, a data-based update rule is derived which adapts the feedforward input signal after each trial. By combining traditional model-based optimal filtering methods with state-of-the-art optimization techniques such as convex programming, an effective and computationally highly efficient learning strategy is obtained. Moreover, the derived formalism allows for the direct treatment of input and state constraints. Different (nonlinear) performance objectives can be specified defining the overall learning behavior. Finally, the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to the benchmark problem of swinging up a pendulum using open-loop control only.},

One difficulty is that the fundamental principles of natural human running motions are not yet fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to show that mathematical optimization is a helpful tool to gain this insight into fast and complex motions. We present physics-based running motions for complex models of human-like running in three dimensions that have been generated by optimization. Running is modeled as a multiphase periodic motion with discontinuities, based on multibody system models of the locomotor system with actuators and spring-damper elements at each joint. The problem of generating gaits is formulated as offline optimal control problem and solved by an efficient direct multiple shooting method. We present optimization results using energy-related criteria and show that they have a close resemblance to running motions of humans. The results provide information about the internal forces and torques required to produce natural human running, as well as on the resulting kinematics.}

Quantum communications requires unusually narrow optical beams and tight pointing performance (on the order of ten microradians) to close an inherently brightness-limited quantum link. This limit is due to quantum communication protocols such as quantum key distribution and teleportation requiring individual quantum states to be transmitted with photon number restrictions. We examine an opportunity to combine quantum communications with laser communications in sharing an optical link. We discuss a combined quantum and laser communication terminal capable of performing space-to-ground entanglement-distribution and high data rate communications on a 12U CubeSat with a 95 mm beam expander and an 60 cm aperture optical ground telescope. Photon pairs produced by the quantum terminal are entangled in polarization so the polarization must be maintained throughout the optical link. We discuss active and passive compensation methods in space and polarization reference frame correction using a polarized reference beacon at the ground station. The combined quantum and laser communication terminal approach enables secure communications over an optical channel with rates of 100 Mbps and sub-nanosecond time transfer.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of classifying terrains into 4 cost classes (free, low-cost, medium-cost, obstacle) for traversability assessment. This requires a robot to reason about both semantics (what objects are present?) and geometric properties (where are the objects located?) of the environment. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel Bird's Eye View Network (BEVNet), a deep neural network that directly predicts a local map encoding terrain classes from sparse LiDAR inputs. BEVNet processes both geometric and semantic information in a temporally consistent fashion. More importantly, it uses learned prior and history to predict terrain classes in unseen space and into the future, allowing a robot to better appraise its situation. We quantitatively evaluate BEVNet on both on-road and off-road scenarios and show that it outperforms a variety of strong baselines.},

The coming years will see the emergence of location-aware networks with submeter accuracy, relying on accurate range measurements provided by wide bandwidth transmissions. In this twopart paper, we determine the fundamental limits of localization accuracy of wideband wireless networks in harsh multipath environments. We first develop a general framework to characterize the localization accuracy of a given node here and then extend our analysis to cooperative location-aware networks in Part II. In this paper, we characterize localization accuracy in terms of a performance measure called the squared position error bound (SPEB), and introduce the notion of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) to derive the SPEB in a succinct expression. This methodology provides insights into the essence of the localization problem by unifying localization information from individual anchors and that from a priori knowledge of the agent's position in a canonical form. Our analysis begins with the received waveforms themselves rather than utilizing only the signal metrics extracted from these waveforms, such as time-of-arrival and received signal strength. Hence, our framework exploits all the information inherent in the received waveforms, and the resulting SPEB serves as a fundamental limit of localization accuracy.},

  abstract = {The availability of position information is of great importance in many commercial, governmental, and military applications. Localization is commonly accomplished through the use of radio communication between mobile devices (agents) and fixed infrastructure (anchors). However, precise determination of agent positions is a challenging task, especially in harsh environments due to radio blockage or limited anchor deployment. In these situations, cooperation among agents can significantly improve localization accuracy and reduce localization outage probabilities. A general framework of analyzing the fundamental limits of wideband localization has been developed in Part I of the paper. Here, we build on this framework and establish the fundamental limits of wideband cooperative location-aware networks. Our analysis is based on the waveforms received at the nodes, in conjunction with Fisher information inequality. We provide a geometrical interpretation of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) for cooperative networks. This approach allows us to succinctly derive fundamental performance limits and their scaling behaviors, and to treat anchors and agents in a unified way from the perspective of localization accuracy. Our results yield important insights into how and when cooperation is beneficial.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel method, combining new formulations and sampling, to improve the scalability of sum-of-squares (SOS) programs-based system verification. Region-of-attraction approximation problems are considered for polynomial, polynomial with generalized Lur'e uncertainty, and rational trigonometric multi-rigid-body systems. Our method starts by identifying that Lagrange multipliers, traditionally heavily used for S-procedures, are a major culprit of creating bloated SOS programs. In light of this, we exploit inherent system properties such as continuity, convexity, and implicit algebraic structure, and reformulate the problems as quotient-ring SOS programs, thereby eliminating all the multipliers. These new programs are smaller, sparser, less constrained, yet less conservative. Their computation is further improved by leveraging a recent result on sampling algebraic varieties. Remarkably, solution correctness is guaranteed with just a finite (in practice, very small) number of samples. Altogether, the proposed method can verify systems well beyond the reach of existing SOS-based approaches (29 states); on smaller problems where a baseline is available, it computes tighter solution 2-3 orders faster. Source code is included.},

With the increasing demands on computational capacity, though numerous studies have explored the efficient training, a comprehensive summarization on acceleration techniques of training deep learning models is still much anticipated. In this survey, we present a detailed review for training acceleration. We consider the fundamental update formulation and split its basic components into five main perspectives: (1) data-centric: including dataset regularization, data sampling, and data-centric curriculum learning techniques, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the data samples; (2) model-centric, including acceleration of basic modules, compression training, model initialization and model-centric curriculum learning techniques, which focus on accelerating the training via reducing the calculations on parameters; (3) optimization-centric, including the selection of learning rate, the employment of large batchsize, the designs of efficient objectives, and model average techniques, which pay attention to the training policy and improving the generality for the large-scale models; (4) budgeted training, including some distinctive acceleration methods on source-constrained situations; (5) system-centric, including some efficient open-source distributed libraries/systems which provide adequate hardware support for the implementation of acceleration algorithms. By presenting this comprehensive taxonomy, our survey presents a comprehensive review to understand the general mechanisms within each component and their joint interaction.},

  abstract = {While imitation learning methods have seen a resurgent interest for robotic manipulation, the well-known problem of compounding errors continues to afflict behavioral cloning (BC). Waypoints can help address this problem by reducing the horizon of the learning problem for BC, and thus, the errors compounded over time. However, waypoint labeling is underspecified, and requires additional human supervision. Can we generate waypoints automatically without any additional human supervision? Our key insight is that if a trajectory segment can be approximated by linear motion, the endpoints can be used as waypoints. We propose Automatic Waypoint Extraction (AWE) for imitation learning, a preprocessing module to decompose a demonstration into a minimal set of waypoints which when interpolated linearly can approximate the trajectory up to a specified error threshold. AWE can be combined with any BC algorithm, and we find that AWE can increase the success rate of state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 25\% in simulation and by 4-28\% on real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, reducing the decision making horizon by up to a factor of 10.

  abstract = {A motion planning algorithm is described for bounding over rough terrain with the \{LittleDog\} robot. Unlike walking gaits, bounding is highly dynamic and cannot be planned with quasi-steady approximations. \{LittleDog\} is modeled as a planar five-link system, with a 16-dimensional state space; computing a plan over rough terrain in this high-dimensional state space that respects the kinodynamic constraints due to underactuation and motor limits is extremely challenging. Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (\{RRTs\}) are known for fast kinematic path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces in the presence of obstacles, but search efficiency degrades rapidly with the addition of challenging dynamics. A computationally tractable planner for bounding was developed by modifying the \{RRT\} algorithm by using: (1) motion primitives to reduce the dimensionality of the problem; (2) Reachability Guidance, which dynamically changes the sampling distribution and distance metric to address differential constraints and discontinuous motion primitive dynamics; and (3) sampling with a Voronoi bias in a lower-dimensional ``task space'' for bounding. Short trajectories were demonstrated to work on the robot, however open-loop bounding is inherently unstable. A feedback controller based on transverse linearization was implemented, and shown in simulation to stabilize perturbations in the presence of noise and time delays.},

This method, which has enjoyed considerable success in the treatment of constrained minimization problems, has been previously applied to problems involving incompressible flow, incompressible elasticity of solids and even frictionless contact. An additional challenge to the method is provided by frictional contact problems governed by a Coulomb law, due to the special form taken by the frictional constraint. This paper describes a new extension of the augmented Lagrangian technique to frictional problems which is well-suited to finite element implementation. The proposed treatment inherits the traditional advantages of augmented Lagrangian techniques over penalty methods; namely, decreased ill-conditioning of governing equations, and essentially exact satisfaction of constraints with finite penalties. A set of numerical examples is presented in which the utility of the method is demonstrated even in the presence of finite deformations and inelasticity.},

  abstract = {In the pursuit of real-time motion planning, a commonly adopted practice is to compute trajectories by running a planning algorithm on a simplified, low-dimensional dynamical model, and then employ a feedback tracking controller that tracks such a trajectory by accounting for the full, high-dimensional system dynamics. While this strategy of planning with model mismatch generally yields fast computation times, there are no guarantees of dynamic feasibility, which hampers application to safety-critical systems. Building upon recent work that addressed this problem through the lens of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, we devise an algorithmic framework whereby one computes, offline, for a pair of ``planner" (i.e., low-dimensional) and ``tracking" (i.e., high-dimensional) models, a feedback tracking controller and associated tracking bound. This bound is then used as a safety margin when generating motion plans via the low-dimensional model. Specifically, we harness the computational tool of sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to design a bilinear optimization algorithm for the computation of the feedback tracking controller and associated tracking bound. The algorithm is demonstrated via numerical experiments, with an emphasis on investigating the trade-off between the increased computational scalability afforded by SOS and its intrinsic conservativeness. Collectively, our results enable scaling the appealing strategy of planning with model mismatch to systems that are beyond the reach of HJ analysis, while maintaining safety guarantees.},

The optimal control problem is formulated as a multi-staged program through a multiple-shooting scheme. This problem structure is exploited within the FORCES Pro framework to retrieve optimal motion plans, contact sequences and control inputs with increased computational efficiency. We investigate our method on a variety of dynamic object manipulation tasks, performed by a six degrees of freedom robot.

The goal of ASTERIA is to achieve arcsecond-level line-of-sight pointing error and highly stable focal plane temperature control. These capabilities enable precision photometry---i.e. the careful measurement of stellar brightness over time---which in turn allows investigation of astrophysical phenomena such as transiting exoplanets. By the end of the 90-day prime mission, ASTERIA had achieved line-of-sight pointing stability of approximately 0.5 arcseconds root mean square (RMS) over 20-minute observations, pointing repeatability of 1 milliarcsecond RMS from one observation to the next, and focal plane temperature stability better than {\textpm}0.01 K over 20-minute observations. This paper presents an overview of the ASTERIA flight and ground system, summarizes the pre-delivery test campaign, and discusses the on-orbit performance obtained by the pointing and thermal control subsystems. We also describe the process for planning opportunistic science observations and present lessons learned from development and operations. Having successfully operated for over 200 days as of this writing, ASTERIA is currently in an extended mission to observe nearby bright stars for transiting exoplanets.},

However, designing robust controllers for highly agile dynamic motions remains a substantial challenge for roboticists. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising data-driven approach for automatically training such controllers. However, exploration in these high-dimensional, underactuated systems remains a significant hurdle for enabling legged robots to learn performant, naturalistic, and versatile agility skills. We propose a framework for training complex robotic skills by transferring experience from existing controllers to jumpstart learning new tasks. To leverage controllers we can acquire in practice, we design this framework to be flexible in terms of their source -- that is, the controllers may have been optimized for a different objective under different dynamics, or may require different knowledge of the surroundings -- and thus may be highly suboptimal for the target task. We show that our method enables learning complex agile jumping behaviors, navigating to goal locations while walking on hind legs, and adapting to new environments. We also demonstrate that the agile behaviors learned in this way are graceful and safe enough to deploy in the real world.},

The Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is allowed to increase in some steps, but the overall trend should be decreasing. The model of practical systems used for stability analysis usually contain uncertainty. Therefore, firstly a non-monotonic stability condition is derived for certain discrete time-delay systems, then robust non-monotonic stability conditions are proposed for uncertain systems. Finally, a novel stabilization algorithm is derived based on the introduced non-monotonic stability condition. The Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the controller are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) or iterative LMI based nonlinear minimization. The proposed theorems are first evaluated by some numerical examples, and then by simulation and implementation on the pH neutralizing process plant.},

  abstract = {CubeSats are miniature satellites used to carry experimental payloads into orbit, where it is often critical to precisely control their attitude. One way to do this is through the use of magnetorquers, which can be integrated into PCBs. This technique saves considerable space and capital when compared with more common torque-rod magnetorquer systems. Here we derive a method of analyzing different PCB-integrated magnetorquer geometries, parametrizing them such that the magnetic moment and efficiency are optimized. Furthermore, by modulating the trace width, the trace number, and other electrical characteristics of the magnetorquer coil, this paper optimizes the generated magnetic moment. Both constant voltage and constant current sources are analyzed as inputs. These optimizations are then simulated in COMSOL for multiple geometries, and it is found that there exists an optimal geometry, given a specified power dissipation. Simulations verify the general trend and maxima of these derivations, barring small, consistent re-scaling in the magnitude of the coil resistance. It is also found that these PCB-integrated magnetorquers provide a sufficient alternative to commercial coil magnetorquers - particularly in volume-restricted configurations. This study extends such analysis to larger CubeSat configurations, and finds that these larger implementations increase magnetorquer efficiency. Optimizations for common PCB-implementable geometries on small satellites are tabulated in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {This article examines the increasingly crucial role played by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in the analysis, design, certification, and support of aerospace products. The status of CFD is described, and we identify opportunities for CFD to have a more substantial impact. The challenges facing CFD are also discussed, primarily in terms of numerical solution, computing power, and physical modelling. We believe the community must find a balance between enthusiasm and rigor. Besides becoming faster and more affordable by exploiting higher computing power, CFD needs to become more reliable, more reproducible across users, and better understood and integrated with other disciplines and engineering processes. Uncertainty quantification is universally considered as a major goal, but will be slow to take hold. The prospects are good for steady problems with Reynolds-Averaged NavierStokes (RANS) turbulence modelling to be solved accurately and without user intervention within a decade -- even for very complex geometries, provided technologies, such as solution adaptation are matured for large three-dimensional problems. On the other hand, current projections for supercomputers show a future rate of growth only half of the rate enjoyed from the 1990s to 2013; true exaflop performance is not close. This will delay pure LargeEddy Simulation (LES) for aerospace applications with their high Reynolds numbers, but hybrid RANS-LES approaches have great potential. Our expectations for a breakthrough in turbulence, whether within traditional modelling or LES, are low and as a result offdesign flow physics including separation will continue to pose a substantial challenge, as will laminar-turbulent transition. We also advocate for much improved user interfaces, providing instant access to rich numerical and physical information as well as warnings over solution quality, and thus naturally training the user.},

Our theory is tested by showing that a straightforward application gives the best known convergence results for several known multiplier updates. Also a characterization of q-superlinear convergence is presented.

Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used. OSQP has already shown a large impact with tens of thousands of users both in academia and in large corporations.},

  abstract = {Space missions are becoming increasingly complex, and engineers are designing multi-satellite architectures with on-orbit operations as means of accomplishing several mission objectives. Multiple concepts have emerged for autonomous robotic servicing and assembly of orbiting assets or the active removal of space debris, all of which rely on close proximity operation of independently controlled elements. In order for engineers to assess whether a chaser satellite can perform a rendezvous and docking to a given target, various factors must be assessed, including the fuel required, maximum thrust required, contact forces and torques, and the time necessary from rendezvous to secure docking. These factors may be defined for any pair of chaser and target satellites. This paper proposes a definition of a feasibility space, consisting of the set of values for the chaser and target over which a given chaser satellite can perform a soft dock to the target. This feasibility space is defined with respect to the target satellite's physical parameters and dynamic state. In order to map the feasibility space, a trajectory type must be specified. This study utilizes an Archimedes Spiral rendezvous approach path. While not a fuel or time optimal trajectory, it has been selected for this analysis because its path may be expressed analytically while the chaser faces the target's docking area throughout the maneuver, thereby keeping the docking location in the field of view of the chaser's rendezvous sensors for as much time as possible. The paper presents the analytical computation of the chaser satellite's requirements based on the expression of an Archimedes Spiral, as well as a method for mapping the feasibility space using non-dimensional parameters to aid in the extensibility for one trajectory type to multiple chasers and targets. Additionally, the paper presents a method of using the resultant feasibility space maps to assist mission planners and chaser satellite designers in determining the likelihood of soft docking success for a given point in the feasibility space. The processes discussed in the paper can be applied to other trajectory types and for any type of chaser or target satellite for future missions.},

  abstract = {Docking with potentially tumbling Targets is a common element of many mission architectures, including on-orbit servicing and active debris removal. This paper studies synchronized docking trajectories as a way to ensure the Chaser satellite remains on the docking axis of the tumbling Target, thereby reducing collision risks and enabling persistent onboard sensing of the docking location. Chaser satellites have limited computational power available to them and the time allowed for the determination of a fuel optimal trajectory may be limited. Consequently, parameterized trajectories that approximate the fuel optimal trajectory while following synchronous approaches may be used to provide a computationally efficient means of determining near optimal trajectories to a tumbling Target. This paper presents a method of balancing the computation cost with the added fuel expenditure required for parameterization, including the selection of a parameterization scheme, the number of parameters in the parameterization, and a means of incorporating the dynamics of a tumbling satellite into the parameterization process. Comparisons of the parameterized trajectories are made with the fuel optimal trajectory, which is computed through the numerical propagation of Euler's equations. Additionally, various tumble types are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the presented computation scheme. With this parameterized trajectory determination method, Chaser satellites may perform terminal approach and docking maneuvers with both fuel and computational efficiency.},

We perform a first investigation of a planning method containing an offline and an online element which can be used to provide reference trajectories in a useful time. The method capabilities include identifying feasible solutions in the presence of a non-static obstacle space and the treatment of a Target satellite in any general tumbling state with angular velocities less than 5 deg/s. We use a safety metric defined as the time-tocollision (ttc) with the Target satellite and show that the planning method can find the global minima for the defined problem within 50 min. The approach maneuver is parametrized using a 6 degree of freedom (dof) task space which describes the final position of the grasping point on the Target satellite and the satellite's final angular velocity. First a global search composed of a coarse, randomized optimization plus a finer smoothing is performed, then the online algorithm interpolates between the pre-computed solutions and provides the reference trajectory to an on-board controller. An estimate for the offline computation times, up to 6 days for a sparse discretization, shows that in the presence of inertia uncertainties of the Target satellite, using parallelized optimization in an online global search can provide solutions on the order of minutes and is more attractive.},

  abstract = {As a spacecraft becomes smaller, a number of physical effects scale both favorably and unfavorably for passive stabilization of the craft. Unfortunately, two separate quantities both scale unfavorably for the use of traditional spinning rotor actuators (e.g. reaction wheels, momentum wheels, control moment gyros) for momentum and attitude control. First, the dominant disturbance torques on small spacecraft in low earth orbit, aerodynamic drag and solar radiation pressure, both become relatively larger as spacecraft size decreases. Second, the effectiveness of spinning rotors reduces as the rotor inertia decreases with the square or the wheel radius. These two factors conspire to greatly reduce the effectiveness of rotor-based momentum control systems at small scales. This reduction requires small spacecraft designers to either devote a significantly larger mass fraction to momentum control or adopt alternative momentum control systems. In this study we examine this problem from two viewpoints. First, empirical data is used to find a relationship between spacecraft size and mass fraction devoted to attitude control. While the International Space Station can devote less than 1\% of its mass fraction to momentum control effectors, GEO telecom spacecraft tend to need around 1-2\% of available mass, and some CubeSats must devote greater than 50\% of their mass fraction. Second, we derive an expression for the smallest spacecraft that can use a reaction wheel for effective momentum management. For reasonable assumptions, this lower limit is on the order of 1 cm length scale, which is in good agreement with the empirical trend. Finally, we list some alternative momentum management strategies and discuss how they apply to spacecraft at the smallest size: the centimeter scale ChipSat.},

Algorithms of this type are known as recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithms. As mentioned in Chap. 2, we can exploit the recursive properties of the Normal Equations, which we have discussed, to derive recursive O(p2) or even fast recursive O(p) algorithms for calculating the updated solution of the Normal Equations at consecutive time steps of observation.},

  abstract = {Spacecraft formations enable a variety of mission concepts, from gravity reconstruction to extrasolar planet detection to heliophysics observatories. In particular, space-based radio interferometers can detect signals in frequency ranges that are absorbed by Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere. Furthermore, such formation missions are now feasible under constrained cost caps due to the growing availability of SmallSat components with spaceflight heritage that are compatible the CubeSat formfactor. Accordingly, we analyze a mission concept operating multiple SmallSats in a passive cluster to establish a space-based interferometer. The goal of this array is to reconstruct radio emissions associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, giving us insight into the particle acceleration occurring during these events. This low-cost mission concept presents a number of unique challenges in regards to mission design and navigation, particularly the configuration of the spacecraft to optimize science return and the reconstruction of precise spacecraft-spacecraft separation values. After providing a brief overview of the mission concept, this paper presents several key features of the mission design and orbit determination strategy that enable this potential heliophysics mission.},

  abstract = {In emergency situations, autonomous vehicles will be forced to operate at their friction limits in order to avoid collisions. In these scenarios, coordinating the planning of the vehicle's path and speed gives the vehicle the best chance of avoiding an obstacle. Fast reaction time is also important in an emergency, but approaches to the trajectory planning problem based on nonlinear optimization are computationally expensive. This paper presents a new scheme that simultaneously modifies the desired path and speed profile for a vehicle in response to the appearance of an obstacle, significant tracking error, or other environmental change. By formulating the trajectory optimization problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program, solution times of less than 20 ms are possible even with a 10-s planning horizon. A simplified point mass model is used to describe the vehicle's motion, but the incorporation of longitudinal weight transfer and road topography means that the vehicle's acceleration limits are modeled more accurately than in comparable approaches. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle in two scenarios demonstrate how the trajectory planner enables the vehicle to avoid an obstacle even when the obstacle appears suddenly and the vehicle is already operating near the friction limits.},

What is causing this gap, and how might we use the answer to improve gradientbased methods? We believe a stochastic formulation of dynamics is one crucial ingredient. We use tools from randomized smoothing to analyze sampling-based approximations of the gradient, and formalize such approximations through the bundled gradient. We show that using the bundled gradient in lieu of the gradient mitigates fast-changing gradients of non-smooth contact dynamics modeled by the implicit time-stepping, or the penalty method. Finally, we apply the bundled gradient to optimal control using iterative MPC, introducing a novel algorithm which improves convergence over using exact gradients. Combining our algorithm with a convex implicit time-stepping formulation of contact, we show that we can tractably tackle planning-through-contact problems in manipulation.},

SELQR applies to robotic systems that have stochastic non-linear dynamics with motion uncertainty modeled by Gaussian distributions that can be state- and control-dependent. In each iteration, SELQR uses a combination of forward and backward value iteration to estimate the cost-to-come and the cost-to-go for each state along a trajectory. SELQR then locally optimizes each state along the trajectory at each iteration to minimize the expected total cost, which results in smoothed states that are used for dynamics linearization and cost function quadratization. SELQR progressively improves the approximation of the expected total cost, resulting in higher quality plans. For applications with imperfect sensing, we extend SELQR to plan in the robot's belief space. We show that our iterative approach achieves fast and reliable convergence to high-quality plans in multiple simulated scenarios involving a car-like robot, a quadrotor, and a medical steerable needle performing a liver biopsy procedure.},

We address two limitations that prevent applications of iLQG to the considered robotic system. First, iLQG assumes a differentiable measurement model, which is not true for range sensors. We show that iLQG only requires the differentiability of the belief dynamics. We propose to use a derivative-free filter to approximate the belief dynamics, which does not require explicit differentiability of the measurement model. Second, informative measurements from a range sensor are sparse. Uninformative measurements produce trivial gradient information, which prevent iLQG optimization from converging to a local minimum. We densify the informative measurements by introducing additional parameters in the measurement model. The parameters are iteratively updated in the optimization to ensure convergence to the true measurement model of a range sensor. We show the effectiveness of the proposed modifications through an ablation study. We also apply the proposed method in simulations of large scale real world environments, which show superior performance comparing to the state-of-the-art methods that either assume the separation principle or maximum likelihood measurements.},

However, this is challenging in agile flights due to nonlinear dynamics, complex aerodynamic effects, and actuation constraints. In this article, we empirically compare two state-of-the-art control frameworks: the nonlinear-model-predictive controller (NMPC) and the differential-flatness-based controller (DFBC), by tracking a wide variety of agile trajectories at speeds up to 20 m/s (i.e., 72 km/h). The comparisons are performed in both simulation and real-world environments to systematically evaluate both methods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. We show the superiority of NMPC in tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories, at the cost of higher computation time and risk of numerical convergence issues. For both methods, we also quantitatively study the effect of adding an inner-loop controller using the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) method, and the effect of adding an aerodynamic drag model. Our real-world experiments, performed in one of the world's largest motion capture systems, demonstrate more than 78\% tracking error reduction of both NMPC and DFBC, indicating the necessity of using an inner-loop controller and aerodynamic drag model for agile trajectory tracking.},

This paper proposes and evaluates two new algorithms, POMCPOW and PFT-DPW, that overcome this deficiency by using weighted particle filtering.

Koopman operator is a linear but an infinite-dimensional operator that governs the time evolution of system outputs in a linear fashion. We exploit this property to synthesize an observer form which enables the use of Luenberger/Kalman-like linear observers for nonlinear estimation. Using the techniques for Koopman eigenvalue/eigenfunction/mode computation, we describe a numerical procedure to construct such an observer form which is often valid in a large portion of state space or even globally. We numerically compare our approach with Extended Kalman Filter and report superior performance.},

By the end of 2012, more than one hundred CubeSats have been launched, and 80 more are manifested for launches in 2013, with at least that many expected in 2014. Ten years ago, CubeSats were routinely dismissed by industry professionals as being too small to be worth flying; now, NASA is the majority launch broker, and a significant share of the manifests are filled by U.S. DoD-sponsored, industry-built CubeSat missions. How did initial perceptions of CubeSats evolve to this state? Are CubeSats toys, tools, or merely another source of orbital debris? With so many CubeSats now in orbit, it is now possible to make a data-based assessment of these missions. Using data collected from a variety of sources, this study evaluates the on-orbit performance of CubeSats. The history of CubeSat missions is reviewed, with the missions classified according to size, origin, mission life, and on-orbit performance. It is shown that several correctable design/implementation errors plague the university side of CubeSat missions, and that the P-POD launch container, not the CubeSat specification, is the true enabling technology for this class of mission.},

  abstract = {The year 2020 marked the start of the Sixth Age of Smallsats. One may sensibly ask, ``Sixth age? What happened to the first five?'' And thus the need for this paper. In this context, "Smallsat" is more of a design ethos than a size classification. One might call it a constraint-driven approach to space mission design, contrasted with the traditional requirements-driven approach. Smallsats are typically associated with rideshare/piggyback/secondary launches, but their distinguishing characteristic is a program-level willingness to aggressively trade mission performance to meet cost and schedule. Herein, I will review the five previous ages of Smallsats (1957-1965, 1966-1981, 1982-1997, 1998-2008, 20092019) and justify these classifications. Specifically, I will show how each age had a distinct set of missions, risk profiles and external opinions of small satellites. Besides the obvious benefit of cleverly dressing up a history paper, the purpose of distinguishing between ages is that it helps us understand how to pursue small-satellite missions in our present age -- especially for those of us stuck in a Fourth-Age mindset. I will demonstrate that we are in a new, sixth age, with a new set of baseline assumptions about the performance and risk associated with small satellites. This Sixth Age has two distinguishing characteristics: 1) Large numbers of Smallsats fly on the same rocket as large, expensive primes, and nobody thinks that this is unusual; 2) Large piles of cash from private \& public financing are converted into commercial satellite-based services. I dub this Sixth Age, ``The Internet Ruins Everything'', based on my concern that the small satellite industry has too many parallels with the Meme Stock craze. I will conclude the paper by convincing myself that I'm wrong about the coming realignment (aka crash), partly because for five years I've been writing worried papers predicting the imminent realignment that hasn't (yet) happened. It won't help.},

State-triggered constraints are different from ordinary constraints found in optimal control in that they use a state-dependent trigger condition to enable or disable a constraint condition, and can be expressed as continuous functions that are readily handled by successive convexification. Compound state-triggered constraints go a step further, giving designers the ability to compose trigger and constraint conditions using Boolean and and or operations. Simulations of the 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent guidance problem obtained using successive convexification are presented to illustrate the utility of state-triggered and compound state-triggered constraints. The examples employ a velocity-triggered angle of attack constraint to alleviate aerodynamic loads, and a collision avoidance constraint to avoid large geological formations. In particular, the velocity-triggered angle of attack constraint demonstrates the ability of state-triggered constraints to introduce new constraint phases to the solution without resorting to combinatorial techniques.},

Originally developed for rocket landing applications, STCs are made up of a trigger condition and a constraint condition that are arranged such that satisfaction of the former implies satisfaction of the latter. Compound STCs go a step further by allowing multiple trigger and constraint conditions to be combined via Boolean ``and'' or ``or'' operations. The logical implications embodied by STCs can be formulated using continuous variables, and thus enable the incorporation of discrete decision making into a continuous optimization framework. In this paper, compound STCs are used to solve quad-rotor path planning problems that would typically require the use of computationally expensive mixedinteger programming techniques. Two scenarios are considered: (1) a quad-rotor flying through a hoop, and (2) a pair of quadrotors carrying a beam-like payload through an obstacle course. Successive convexification is used to solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that our approach can reliably generate trajectories at rates upwards of 3 and 1.5 Hz for the first and second scenarios, respectively.},

To this end, we extended the modeling capabilities of factor graphs to represent nonlinear dynamics using constraint factors. For inference, we reformulate Sequential Quadratic Programming as an optimization algorithm on a factor graph with nonlinear constraints.

Our heuristic is based on a variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an algorithm for solving convex optimisation problems. We discuss the favourable computational aspects of our algorithm, which allow it to run quickly even on very modest computational platforms such as embedded processors. We give several examples for which an approximate solution should be found very quickly, such as management of a hybrid-electric vehicle drivetrain and control of switched-mode power converters. Our numerical experiments suggest that our method is very effective in finding a feasible point with small objective value; indeed, we see that in many cases, it finds the global solution.},

So each player need not know about the population action. Moreover, no specific control by the central coordinator is required.

Many applications also require adaptivity to diverse parts, poses, and environments, as well as low cycle times. In other areas of robotics, simulation is a powerful tool to develop algorithms, generate datasets, and train agents. However, simulation has had a more limited impact on assembly. We present IndustReal, a set of algorithms, systems, and tools that solve assembly tasks in simulation with reinforcement learning (RL) and successfully achieve policy transfer to the real world. Specifically, we propose 1) simulation-aware policy updates, 2) signed-distance-field rewards, and 3) sampling-based curricula for robotic RL agents. We use these algorithms to enable robots to solve contact-rich pick, place, and insertion tasks in simulation. We then propose 4) a policy-level action integrator to minimize error at policy deployment time. We build and demonstrate a real-world robotic assembly system that uses the trained policies and action integrator to achieve repeatable performance in the real world. Finally, we present hardware and software tools that allow other researchers to reproduce our system and results.

From this point of view, a new update rule for the Lagrange multipliers which depends on the particular quasi-Newton method employed is given. This update rule, in contrast to most other update rules, does not require exact minimization of the intermediate unconstrained problem. In fact, the optimal convergence rate is attained in the extreme case when only one step of a quasi-Newton method is taken on this intermediate problem. The second approach transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem of the same dimension.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an autonomous orbit control of a satellite in Low Earth Orbit is investigated using model predictive control. The absolute orbit control problem is transformed to a relative orbit control problem in which the desired states of the reference orbit are the orbital elements of a virtual satellite which is not affected by undesirable perturbations. The relative motion is modeled by Gauss?s variational equations including J2 and drag perturbations which are the dominant perturbations in Low Earth Orbit. The advantage of using Gauss?s variational equations over the Cartesian formulations is that not only the linearization errors are much smaller, but also each orbital element can be controlled independently. Model predictive control finds the finite horizon optimal firing times of the satellite thrusters. The problem of orbit control has been cast as a linear programming which is a subset of convex optimization problems. As a result, model predictive control can maintain and control orbits of Low Earth Orbit satellites in optimal way, and this modern control technique can be an alternative for traditional analytical-based orbit control methods. Also, a comparison between model predictive control and linear quadratic regulator orbit control showed the superiority of MPC in fuel consumption.},

This is a review of active learning in robotics, focusing on methods amenable to the demands of embodied learning systems. Robots must be able to learn efficiently and flexibly through continuous online deployment. This poses a distinct set of control-oriented challenges---one must choose suitable measures as objectives, synthesize real-time control, and produce analyses that guarantee performance and safety with limited knowledge of the environment or robot itself. In this work, we survey the fundamental components of robotic active learning systems. We discuss classes of learning tasks that robots typically encounter, measures with which they gauge the information content of observations, and algorithms for generating action plans. Moreover, we provide a variety of examples -- from environmental mapping to nonparametric shape estimation -- that highlight the qualitative differences between learning tasks, information measures, and control techniques. We conclude with a discussion of control-oriented open challenges, including safety-constrained learning and distributed learning.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a new error-state Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach on connected matrix Lie groups for robot control. The linearized tracking error dynamics and the linearized equations of motion are derived in the Lie algebra. Moreover, given an initial condition, the linearized tracking error dynamics and equations of motion are globally valid and evolve independently of the system trajectory. By exploiting the symmetry of the problem, the proposed approach shows faster convergence of rotation and position simultaneously than the state-of-the-art geometric variational MPC based on variational-based linearization. Numerical simulation on tracking control of a fully-actuated 3D rigid body dynamics confirms the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the baselines. Furthermore, the proposed MPC is also verified in pose control and locomotion experiments on a quadrupedal robot MIT Mini Cheetah.}

In our primary contribution, we show that the derivatives of a unit quaternion in terms of its MRPs are simple polynomial expressions of its scalar and vector part. Furthermore, we show that updates to unit quaternions from perturbations in parameter space can be computed without explicitly invoking the parameters in the computations. Based on the former, we introduce a novel approach for designing orientation splines by configuring their backprojections in 3D space. Finally, in the general topic of nonlinear optimization for geometric vision, we run performance analyses and provide comparisons on the convergence behavior of MRP parameterizations on the tasks of absolute orientation, exterior orientation and large-scale bundle adjustment of public datasets.},

  abstract = {Stability is as essential to flying as lift itself, but previous discussions of how flying animals maintain stability have been limited in both number and scope. By developing the pitching moment equations for gliding animals and by discussing potential sources of roll and yaw stability, we consider the various sources of static stability used by gliding animals. We find that gliding animals differ markedly from aircraft in how they maintain stability. In particular, the pendulum stability provided when the centre of gravity lies below the wings is a much more important source of stability in flying animals than in most conventional aircraft. Drag-based stability also appears to be important for many gliding animals, whereas in aircraft, drag is usually kept to a minimum. One unexpected consequence of these differences is that the golden measure of static pitching stability in aircraft---the static margin---can only strictly be applied to flying animals if the equilibrium angle of attack is specified. We also derive several rules of thumb by which stable fliers can be identified. Stable fliers are expected to exhibit one or more of the following features: (1) Wings that are swept forward in slow flight. (2) Wings that are twisted down at the tips when swept back (wash-out) and twisted up at the tips when swept forwards (wash-in). (3) Additional lifting surfaces (canard, hindwings or a tail) inclined nose-up to the main wing if they lie forward of it, and nose-down if they lie behind it (longitudinal dihedral). Each of these predictions is directional---the opposite is expected to apply in unstable animals. In addition, animals with reduced stability are expected to display direct flight patterns in turbulent conditions, in contrast to the erratic flight patterns predicted for stable animals, in which large restoring forces are generated. Using these predictions, we find that flying animals possess a far higher degree of inherent stability than has generally been recognized. This conclusion is reinforced by measurements of the relative positions of the centres of gravity and lift in birds, which suggest that the wings alone may be sufficient to provide longitudinal static stability. Birds may therefore resemble tailless aircraft more closely than conventional aircraft with a tailplane.},

Most of the current applications of soft robotic manipulators utilize static or quasi-dynamic controllers based on kinematic models or linearity in the joint space. However, such approaches are not truly exploiting the rich dynamics of a soft-bodied system. In this paper, we present a model-based policy learning algorithm for closed-loop predictive control of a soft robotic manipulator. The forward dynamic model is represented using a recurrent neural network. The closed-loop policy is derived using trajectory optimization and supervised learning. The approach is verified first on a simulated piecewise constant strain model of a cable driven under-actuated soft manipulator. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate on a soft pneumatically actuated manipulator how closed-loop control policies can be derived that can accommodate variable frequency control and unmodeled external loads.},

  abstract = {Formation flying of multiple spacecraft is an enabling technology for many future space science missions. These future missions will, for example, use the highly coordinated, distributed array of vehicles for earth mapping interferometers and synthetic aperture radar. This thesis presents coordination and control algorithms designed for a fleet of spacecraft. These algorithms are embedded in a hierarchical fleet architecture that includes a high-level coordinator for the fleet maneuvers used to form, re-size, or re-target the formation configuration and low-level controllers to generate and implement the individual control inputs for each vehicle. The trajectory and control problems are posed as linear programming (LP) optimizations to solve for the minimum fuel maneuvers. The combined result of the high-level coordination and low-level controllers is a very flexible optimization framework that can be used off-line to analyze aspects of a mission design and in real-time as part of an on-board autonomous formation flying control system. This thesis also investigates several critical issues associated with the implementation of this formation flying approach. In particular, modifications to the LP algorithms are presented to: include robustness to sensor noise, include actuator constraints, ensure that the optimization solutions are always feasible, and reduce the LP solution times. Furthermore, the dynamics for the control problem are analyzed in terms of two key issues: 1) what dynamics model should be used to specify the desired state to maintain a passive aperture; and 2) what dynamics model should be used in the LP to represent the motion about this state. Several linearized models of the relative dynamics are considered in this analysis, including Hill's equations for circular orbits, modified linear dynamics that partially account for the J2 effects, and Lawden's equations for eccentric orbits. The complete formation flying control approach is successfully demonstrated using a nonlinear simulation environment that includes realistic measurement noises, disturbances, and actuator nonlinearities.},

The new method constructs an affine feedback control law, obtained by minimizing a novel quadratic approximation to the optimal cost-to-go function. Global convergence is guaranteed through a Levenberg-Marquardt method; convergence in the vicinity of a local minimum is quadratic. Performance is illustrated on a limited-torque inverted pendulum problem, as well as a complex biomechanical control problem involving a stochastic model of the human arm, with 10 state dimensions and 6 muscle actuators.

Here we develop the first model of contact dynamics defined in both the forward and inverse directions. The contact impulse is the solution to a convex optimization problem: minimize kinetic energy in contact space subject to non-penetration and friction-cone constraints. We use a custom interior-point method to make the optimization problem unconstrained; this is key to defining the forward and inverse dynamics in a consistent way. The resulting model has a parameter which sets the amount of contact smoothing, facilitating continuation methods for optimization. We implemented the proposed contact solver in our new physics engine (MuJoCo). A full Newton step of trajectory optimization for a 3D walking gait takes only 160 msec, on a 12-core PC.},

Contact responses are computed via efficient new algorithms we have developed, based on the modern velocity-stepping approach which avoids the difficulties with spring-dampers. Models are specified using either a high-level C++ API or an intuitive XML file format. A built-in compiler transforms the user model into an optimized data structure used for runtime computation. The engine can compute both forward and inverse dynamics. The latter are well-defined even in the presence of contacts and equality constraints. The model can include tendon wrapping as well as actuator activation states (e.g. pneumatic cylinders or muscles). To facilitate optimal control applications and in particular sampling and finite differencing, the dynamics can be evaluated for different states and controls in parallel. Around 400,000 dynamics evaluations per second are possible on a 12-core machine, for a 3D homanoid with 18 dofs and 6 active contacts. We have already used the engine in a number of control applications. It will soon be made publicly available.},

Due to its wavelength- or sub-wavelength scale diameter and relatively large index contrast between the core and cladding, an MNF can offer engineerable waveguiding properties including optical confinement, fractional evanescent fields and surface intensity, which is very attractive to optical sensing on the micro and nanometer scale. In particular, the waveguided low-loss tightly confined large fractional evanescent fields, enabled by atomic level surface roughness and extraordinary geometric and material uniformity in a glass MNF, is one of its most prominent merits in realizing optical sensing with high sensitivity and great versatility. Meanwhile, the mesoporous matrix and small diameter of a polymer MNF, make it an excellent host fibre for functional materials for fast-response optical sensing. In this tutorial, we first introduce the basics of MNF optics and MNF optical sensors, and review the progress and current status of this field. Then, we discuss challenges and prospects of MNF sensors to some extent, with several clues for future studies. Finally, we conclude with a brief outlook for MNF optical sensors}

Our framework answers a need demonstrated at the Darpa Robotics Challenge, where the lack of an automatic acyclic contact planner was recognized a major issue. Our novel key idea is the reachability condition. Informally, it verifies that the root configuration of a robot is " close, but not too close " from obstacles: close to allow contact creation, not too close to avoid collision. With this approximation of the space of admissible root configurations we decompose the hard contact planning problem into simpler sub-problems: first, to plan a guide path for the root without considering the whole-body configuration; then, to generate a discrete sequence of whole-body configurations in static equilibrium along this path. The reachability condition turns the high-dimensional computation of the guide into a collision checking problem, solved in less than a few seconds. Then a deterministic contact selection algorithm tackles the combinatorial issue of generating of a discrete sequence along the guide path. Several innovations make it computationally efficient: a criterion for verifying static equilibrium, and a set of heuristics used to enforce desirable properties on the configuration. Our approach results from the pragmatic choice of favoring efficiency over exhaustiveness, justified empirically: in a few seconds, with satisfying success rates, we generate complex contact plans for various scenarios and robots, namely HRP-2, HyQ, and a dexterous hand.},

  abstract = {Motivated by robotic trajectory optimization problems we consider the Augmented Lagrangian approach to constrained optimization. We first propose an alternative augmentation of the Lagrangian to handle the inequality case (not based on slack variables) and a corresponding "central" update of the dual parameters. We proove certain properties of this update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when the "constraint activity" does not change between iterations, the KKT conditions hold after just one iteration. This gives essential insight on when the method is efficient in practise. We then present our main contribution, which are consistent any-time (non-central) updates of the dual parameters (i.e., updating the dual parameters when we are not currently at an extremum of the Lagrangian). Similar to the primal-dual Newton method, this leads to an algorithm that parallely updates the primal and dual solutions, not distinguishing between an outer loop to adapt the dual parameters and an inner loop to minimize the Lagrangian. We again proof certain properties of this anytime update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when constraint activities would not change, the dual solution converges after one iteration. Again, this gives essential insight in the caveats of the method: if constraint activities change the method may destablize. We propose simple smoothing, step-size adaptation and regularization mechanisms to counteract this effect and guarantee monotone convergence. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on random LPs as well as on standard robot trajectory optimization problems, confirming our motivation and intuition that our approach performs well if the problem structure implies moderate stability of constraint activity.},

For researchers that work in the intersections of machine learning, robotics, control, and optimization, such relations are highly relevant but sometimes hard to see across disciplines, due also to the different notations and conventions used in the disciplines. The aim of this tutorial is to introduce to constrained trajectory optimization in a manner that allows us to establish these relations. We consider a basic but general formalization of the problem and discuss the structure of Newton steps in this setting. The computation of Newton steps can then be related to dynamic programming, establishing relations to DDP, iLQG, and AICO. We can also clarify how inverting a banded symmetric matrix is related to dynamic programming as well as message passing in Markov chains and factor graphs. Further, for a machine learner, path optimization and Gaussian Processes seem intuitively related problems. We establish such a relation and show how to solve a Gaussian Process-regularized path optimization problem efficiently. Further topics include how to derive an optimal controller around the path, model predictive control in constrained k-order control processes, and the pullback metric interpretation of the Gauss--Newton approximation.},

  abstract = {The smallsat revolution has impacted the architecture of most modern satellites with the notable exception of finepointing space telescopes. Conventional attitude control hardware scales poorly as the spacecraft gets smaller, resulting in significant mass and performance penalties for nanosatellites with strict pointing requirements. This paper presents a novel attitude actuation and planning strategy that utilizes actuated booms with tip masses and magnetorquers for three-axis pointing and momentum desaturation. The speed of the booms is an appropriate match for the slowly varying environmental disturbance torques encountered in low-Earth orbit. As a result, these booms do not create the high-frequency jitter that reaction wheels do, lessening the need for complex second-stage correction hardware in the payload. An optimization-based motion planner is able to reason about the orbital ephemeris to ensure the booms never exceed their actuation limits, and a Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller is able to maintain fine-pointing during times of payload operation.},

  abstract = {As scientific and crewed payloads have more demanding goals, precise atmospheric entry guidance is playing an increasing role in mission success. State-of-the-art entry guidance algorithms are structured in a predictor-corrector framework, where a simulation is used to predict a trajectory, and corrections are then made to the control inputs. These guidance methods are simple and effective, but current algorithms assume low lift-to-drag entry vehicles, are limited to only bank-angle control, and have a limited ability to guarantee the safety of the vehicle. We propose a new predictor-corrector entry guidance method that formulates the correction step as a convex optimization problem. This allows for more flexibility in specifying the vehicle's dynamics and control inputs, and the ability to explicitly handle safety constraints such as heating, pressure, and acceleration limits. We test the new algorithm in Mars entry scenarios similar to the Mars Science Laboratory with both bank-angle control and bank-angle plus angle-ofattack control, demonstrating both its performance and ability to generalize to future vehicle capabilities.},

  abstract = {Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.},

An ad-hoc modification of the update law for the gain in the RLS scheme is proposed and used in simulation and experiments. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme estimates mass within 5\% of its actual value and tracks grade with good accuracy provided that inputs are persistently exciting.

If these signals are continuously present, then they cannot be removed by the usual techniques of detection and blanking. We have previously proposed a spatial filtering technique, where the impact of the interferer is projected out from the estimated covariance data. Assuming that the spatial signature of the interferer is time-varying, several such estimates can be combined to recover the missing dimensions. In this paper, we give a detailed performance analysis of this algorithm. It is shown that the spatial filter introduces a small increase in variance of the estimates (because of the loss in information) and that the algorithm is unbiased in case the true spatial signatures of the interferers are known but that there may be a bias in case the signatures are estimated from the same data. Some of the bias may be removed, and moreover, the bias only affects the auto-correlations, whereas the astronomical information is mostly in the cross-correlations.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present LQG-MP (linear-quadratic Gaussian motion planning), a new approach to robot motion planning that takes into account the sensors and the controller that will be used during the execution of the robot's path. LQG-MP is based on the linear-quadratic controller with Gaussian models of uncertainty, and explicitly characterizes in advance (i.e. before execution) the a priori  probability distributions of the state of the robot along its path. These distributions can be used to assess the quality of the path, for instance by computing the probability of avoiding collisions. Many methods can be used to generate the required ensemble of candidate paths from which the best path is selected; in this paper we report results using rapidly exploring random trees (RRT). We study the performance of LQG-MP with simulation experiments in three scenarios: (A) a kinodynamic car-like robot, (B) multi-robot planning with differential-drive robots, and (C) a 6-DOF serial manipulator. We also present a method that applies Kalman smoothing to make paths Ck-continuous and apply LQG-MP to precomputed roadmaps using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find high-quality paths.}

  abstract = {We present a new approach to motion planning under sensing and motion uncertainty by computing a locally optimal solution to a continuous partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Our approach represents beliefs (the distributions of the robot's state estimate) by Gaussian distributions and is applicable to robot systems with non-linear dynamics and observation models. The method follows the general POMDP solution framework in which we approximate the belief dynamics using an extended Kalman filter and represent the value function by a quadratic function that is valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. Using a belief space variant of iterative LQG (iLQG), our approach iterates with second-order convergence towards a linear control policy over the belief space that is locally optimal with respect to a user-defined cost function. Unlike previous work, our approach does not assume maximumlikelihood observations, does not assume fixed estimator or control gains, takes into account obstacles in the environment, and does not require discretization of the state and action spaces. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial (O[n6]) in the dimension n of the state space. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in simulation for holonomic and nonholonomic robots maneuvering through environments with obstacles with noisy and partial sensing and with non-linear dynamics and observation models.},

This result is applied to obtain a new approach for solving the symmetric indefinite systems arising in interior-point methods for linear and quadratic programming. These systems are typically solved either by reducing to a positive definite system or by performing a Bunch-Parlett factorization of the full indefinite system at every iteration. This is an intermediate approach based on reducing to a quasidefinite system. This approach entails less fill-in than further reducing to a positive definite system, but is based on a static ordering and is therefore more efficient than performing BunchParlett factorizations of the original indefinite system.},

  abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. [I] proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state-estimation. This was extended to parameterestimation by Wan and van der Menve [2, 31. The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of O ( L {\textasciitilde} )f'or general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameterestimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an (3(L2)implementation. This paper introduces the squareroot unscented Kalman jilter (SR-UKF) which is also U ( L 3 )for general state-estimation and U ( L 2 )for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was U ( L 3 ) ) .In addition, the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances.},

  abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

State estimation techniques that explicitly capture the dynamics of contact offer the potential to reduce estimation errors from unplanned contact events and improve closed-loop control performance. This is particularly true in highly dynamic situations where common simplifications like no-slip or quasi-static sliding are violated. Incorporating contact constraints requires care to address the numerical challenges associated with discontinuous dynamics, which make straightforward application of derivative-based techniques such as the Extended Kalman Filter impossible. In this paper, we derive an approximate maximum a posteriori estimator that can handle rigid body contact by explicitly imposing contact constraints in the observation update. We compare the performance of this estimator to an existing state-of-the-art Unscented Kalman Filter designed for estimation through contact and demonstrate the scalability of the approach by estimating the state of a 20-DOF bipedal robot in realtime.},

The conventional way of computing invariant manifolds involves determining the stable and unstable directions across the entire orbit through an eigendecomposition of the monodromy matrix of the periodic orbit. These directions are then propagated along the entire orbit with the state transition matrix. This paper presents a simpler method for computing invariant manifolds without relying on the monodromy matrix or its eigendecomposition, so that invariant manifolds of unstable objects besides periodic orbits can be computed.

  abstract = {The book treats hypersonic flight trajectories and atmospheric entry flight mechanics in light of their importance for space shuttle entry. Following a review of the structures of planetary atmospheres and aerodynamic forces, equations are derived for flight over a spherical planet, and the performance of long-range hypervelocity vehicles in extra-atmospheric flight is analyzed. Consideration is then given to vehicle trajectories in the powered and atmospheric reentry phases of flight, and several first-order solutions are derived for various planetary entry situations. The second-order theory of Loh for entry trajectories is presented along with the classical theories of Yaroshevskii and Chapman for entry into planetary atmospheres, and the thermal problems encountered in hypersonic flight are analyzed. A unified theory for entry into planetary atmospheres is then introduced which allows the performance of a general type of lifting vehicle to be studied, and applied to the analysis of orbit contraction due to atmospheric drag, flight with lift modulation and lateral maneuvers.},

  abstract = {Convex optimization is a vibrant and successful area due to the existence of a variety of efficient algorithms that leverage the rich structure provided by convexity. Convexity of a smooth set or a function in a Euclidean space is defined by how it interacts with the standard differential structure in this space -- the Hessian of a convex function has to be positive semi-definite everywhere. However, in recent years, there is a growing demand to understand non-convexity and develop computational methods to optimize non-convex functions. Intriguingly, there is a type of non-convexity that disappears once one introduces a suitable differentiable structure and redefines convexity with respect to the straight lines, or \{{\textbackslash}em geodesics\}, with respect to this structure. Such convexity is referred to as \{{\textbackslash}em geodesic convexity\}. Interest in studying it arises due to recent reformulations of some non-convex problems as geodesically convex optimization problems over geodesically convex sets. Geodesics on manifolds have been extensively studied in various branches of Mathematics and Physics. However, unlike convex optimization, understanding geodesics and geodesic convexity from a computational point of view largely remains a mystery. The goal of this exposition is to introduce the first part of geodesic convex optimization -- geodesic convexity -- in a self-contained manner. We first present a variety of notions from differential and Riemannian geometry such as differentiation on manifolds, geodesics, and then introduce geodesic convexity. We conclude by showing that certain non-convex optimization problems such as computing the Brascamp-Lieb constant and the operator scaling problem have geodesically convex formulations.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful technique for solving dynamic control tasks. In this paper, we show that there exists a close connection between MPC and online learning, an abstract theoretical framework for analyzing online decision making in the optimization literature. This new perspective provides a foundation for leveraging powerful online learning algorithms to design MPC algorithms. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm based on dynamic mirror descent (DMD), an online learning algorithm that is designed for non-stationary setups. Our algorithm, Dynamic Mirror Descent Model Predictive Control (DMD-MPC), represents a general family of MPC algorithms that includes many existing techniques as special instances. DMD-MPC also provides a fresh perspective on previous heuristics used in MPC and suggests a principled way to design new MPC algorithms. In the experimental section of this paper, we demonstrate the flexibility of DMD-MPC, presenting a set of new MPC algorithms on a simple simulated cartpole and a simulated and real-world aggressive driving task.

Mach., 12 (1965), pp. 547--560], which we accordingly call Anderson acceleration here. This method has enjoyed considerable success and wide usage in electronic structure computations, where it is known as Anderson mixing; however, it seems to have been untried or underexploited in many other important applications. Moreover, while other acceleration methods have been extensively studied by the mathematics and numerical analysis communities, this method has received relatively little attention from these communities over the years. A recent paper by H. Fang and Y. Saad [Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 16 (2009), pp. 197--221] has clarified a remarkable relationship of Anderson acceleration to quasi-Newton (secant updating) methods and extended it to define a broader Anderson family of acceleration methods. In this paper, our goals are to shed additional light on Anderson acceleration and to draw further attention to its usefulness as a general tool. We first show that, on linear problems, Anderson acceleration without truncation is ``essentially equivalent'' in a certain sense to the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. We also show that the Type 1 variant in the Fang--Saad Anderson family is similarly essentially equivalent to the Arnoldi (full orthogonalization) method. We then discuss practical considerations for implementing Anderson acceleration and illustrate its performance through numerical experiments involving a variety of applications.},

In the outer loop, two coordinates of the angular rate vector are considered as virtual controls and designed to asymptotically stabilize the quaternions and the third angular rate. In the inner loop, robust sliding mode controller is designed in terms of the control torque inputs to accurately track the command profiles produced by the outer loop controller. Stability of the outer loop is proved using LaSalle's and Floquet's theorems. A numerical example is considered. Theoretical results are confirmed via computer simulation.},

  abstract = {A widely recognized shortcoming of model predictive control (MPC) is that it can usually only be used in applications with slow dynamics, where the sample time is measured in seconds or minutes. A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the online controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of a control-Lyapunov policy, with quadratic Lyapunov function, requires the solution of a quadratic program (QP) at each time step. For small problems this QP can be solved explicitly; for larger problems an on-line optimization method can be used. For this reason the control-Lyapunov control policy is considered a computationally intensive control law, as opposed to an `analytical' control law, such as conventional linear state feedback, LQG, or H-infinity, too complex or slow to be used in high speed control applications. In this note we show that by pre-computing certain quantities, the control-Lyapunov policy can be evaluated extremely efficiently. We will show that when the number of inputs is on the order of the square-root of the state dimension, the cost of evaluating a control-Lyapunov policy is on the same order as the cost of evaluating a simple linear state feedback policy, and less (in order) than the cost of updating a Kalman filter state estimate. To give an idea of the speeds involved, for a problem with 100 states and 10 inputs, the control-Lyapunov policy can be evaluated in around 67us, on a 2GHz AMD processor; the same processor requires 44us to carry out a Kalman filter update.},

The main contribution is the transformation of the original nonlinear optimal control problem into a sequence of convex optimization problems. First, the control is decoupled from the states through a change of variables. Then, by introducing a lossless convexification technique, the control constraints are convexified, and the original problem is relaxed into a sequence of second-order cone programming problems. The resulting subproblems can be solved in real time by efficient interior-point methods. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the three-dimensional minimum-fuel Earth-to-Mars low-thrust transfer problem.},

  abstract = {Many tasks in modern machine learning can be formulated as finding equilibria in sequential games. In particular, two-player zero-sum sequential games, also known as minimax optimization, have received growing interest. It is tempting to apply gradient descent to solve minimax optimization given its popularity and success in supervised learning. However, it has been noted that naive application of gradient descent fails to find some local minimax and can converge to nonlocal-minimax points. In this paper, we propose Follow-the-Ridge (FR), a novel algorithm that provably converges to and only converges to local minimax. We show theoretically that the algorithm addresses the notorious rotational behaviour of gradient dynamics, and is compatible with preconditioning and positive momentum. Empirically, FR solves toy minimax problems and improves the convergence of GAN training compared to the recent minimax optimization algorithms.},

However, learning complex long-horizon tasks often requires an unattainable amount of demonstrations. To reduce the high data requirement, we resort to human play data - video sequences of people freely interacting with the environment using their hands. Even with different morphologies, we hypothesize that human play data contain rich and salient information about physical interactions that can readily facilitate robot policy learning. Motivated by this, we introduce a hierarchical learning framework named MimicPlay that learns latent plans from human play data to guide low-level visuomotor control trained on a small number of teleoperated demonstrations. With systematic evaluations of 14 long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real world, we show that MimicPlay outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning methods in task success rate, generalization ability, and robustness to disturbances.

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

Our insight is that optical flow, a technique normally used for motion estimation in video, can also provide an effective representation for corresponding cloth poses across observation and goal images. We introduce FabricFlowNet (FFN), a cloth manipulation policy that leverages flow as both an input and as an action representation to improve performance. FabricFlowNet also elegantly switches between bimanual and single-arm actions based on the desired goal. We show that FabricFlowNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based cloth manipulation policies that take image input. We also present real-world experiments on a bimanual system, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer.  Finally, we show that our method generalizes when trained on a single square cloth to other cloth shapes, such as T-shirts and rectangular cloths.

  abstract = {In this work, variational integrators of higher order for dynamical systems with holonomic constraints are constructed and analyzed. The construction is based on approximating the configuration and the Lagrange multiplier via different polynomials. The splitting of the augmented Lagrangian in two parts enables the use of different quadrature formulas to approximate the integral of each part. Conditions are derived that ensure the linear independence of the higher order constrained discrete EulerLagrange equations and stiff accuracy. Time reversibility is investigated for the discrete flow on configuration level only as for the flow on configuration and momentum level. The fulfillment of the hidden constraints plays an important role for the time reversibility of the presented integrators. The order of convergence is investigated numerically. Order reduction of the momentum and the Lagrange multiplier compared to the order of the configuration occurs in general, but can be avoided by fulfilling the hidden constraints in a simple post processing step. Regarding efficiency versus accuracy a numerical analysis yields that higher orders increase the accuracy of the discrete solution substantially while the computational costs decrease. A comparison to the constrained Galerkin methods in Marsden and West (Acta Numerica 10, 357--514 2001) and the symplectic SPARK integrators of Jay (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 45(5), 1814--1842 2007) reveals that the approach presented here is more general and thus allows for more flexibility in the design of the integrator.},

Convex optimization problems are an important subclass, admitting global solutions and mature solution methods. Recent attention has focused on geodesic convexity, or g-convexity, which allows non-convex problems to be transformed into convex ones posed over Riemannian manifolds. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a bridge between g-convexity and contraction analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we show the equivalence between strong geodesic convexity and contraction of natural gradient flows. Given this result, existing tools for the analysis and synthesis of nonlinear contracting systems can be considered to both discover and efficiently optimize g-convex functions. In addition, the contraction perspective allows one to easily apply results to time-varying optimization settings, and to recursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements.},

We present efficient and novel analytical gradients through the LCP formulation of inelastic contact that exploit the sparsity of the LCP solution. We support complex contact geometry, and gradients approximating continuous-time elastic collision. We also introduce a novel method to compute complementarity-aware gradients that help downstream optimization tasks avoid stalling in saddle points. We show that an implementation of this combination in an existing physics engine (DART) is capable of a 45x single-core speedup over finite-differencing in computing analytical Jacobians for a single timestep, while preserving all the expressiveness of original DART.},

Communication scheduling, coordinated duty cycling, and time synchronization can make use of a synchronicity primitive that achieves a tight alignment of individual nodes' firing phases. In this paper we present the Reachback Firefly Algorithm (RFA), a decentralized synchronicity algorithm implemented on TinyOS-based motes. Our algorithm is based on a mathematical model that describes how fireflies and neurons spontaneously synchronize. Previous work has assumed idealized nodes and not considered realistic effects of sensor network communication, such as message delays and loss. Our algorithm accounts for these effects by allowing nodes to use delayed information from the past to adjust the future firing phase. We present an evaluation of RFA that proceeds on three fronts. First, we prove the convergence of our algorithm in simple cases and predict the effect of parameter choices. Second, we leverage the TinyOS simulator to investigate the effects of varying parameter choice and network topology. Finally, we present results obtained on an indoor sensor network testbed demonstrating that our algorithm can synchronize sensor network devices to within 100 {\textmu}sec on a real multi-hop topology with links of varying quality.},

  abstract = {We capture the shape of moving cloth using a custom set of color markers printed on the surface of the cloth. The output is a sequence of triangle meshes with static connectivity and with detail at the scale of individual markers in both smooth and folded regions. We compute markers' coordinates in space using correspondence across multiple synchronized video cameras. Correspondence is determined from color information in small neighborhoods and refined using a novel strain pruning process. Final correspondence does not require neighborhood information. We use a novel data driven hole-filling technique to fill occluded regions. Our results include several challenging examples: a wrinkled shirt sleeve, a dancing pair of pants, and a rag tossed onto a cup. Finally, we demonstrate that cloth capture is reusable by animating a pair of pants using human motion capture data.},

  abstract = {The promise of legged robots over standard wheeled robots is to provide{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;improved mobility over rough terrain. This promise builds on the{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;decoupling between the environment and the main body of the robot that{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;the presence of articulated legs allows, with two consequences. First,{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;the motion of the main body of the robot can be made largely independent{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;from the roughness of the terrain, within the kinematic limits of the{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;legs: legs provide an active suspension system. Indeed, one of the most advanced{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;hexapod robots of the 1980s was aptly called the Adaptive Suspension{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;Vehicle. Second, this decoupling allows{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;legs to temporarily leave their contact with the ground: isolated{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;footholds on a discontinuous terrain can be overcome, allowing to visit{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;places absolutely out of reach otherwise. Note that having feet firmly{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;planted on the ground is not mandatory here: skating is an equally{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;interesting option, although rarely approached so far in robotics. Unfortunately, this promise comes at the cost of a hindering increase in{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;complexity. It is only with the unveiling of the Honda P2 humanoid robot{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;in 1996, and later of the Boston Dynamics BigDog{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;quadruped robot in 2005 that legged robots finally began to deliver{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;real-life capacities that are just beginning to match the long sought{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;animal-like mobility over rough terrain. In fact, work in legged{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;robotics has even contributed to the understanding of human and animal{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;locomotion, as evidenced by the many fruitful collaborations between{\textbackslash}\&nbsp;robotics and biomechanics researchers over legged locomotion.},

For general nonlinear dynamic systems, finding globally ``best'' trajectories is typically not feasible; however, given an initial estimate of the model parameters and an initial trajectory, we present a continuous-time optimization method that produces a locally optimal trajectory for parameter estimation in the presence of measurement noise. The optimization algorithm is formulated to find system trajectories that improve a norm on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). A double-pendulum cart apparatus is used to numerically and experimentally validate this technique. In simulation, the optimized trajectory increases the minimum eigenvalue of the FIM by three orders of magnitude, compared with the initial trajectory. Experimental results show that this optimized trajectory translates to an order-of-magnitude improvement in the parameter estimate error in practice.},

Our phase-based parameterization of feet motion and forces allows to optimize over the discrete gait sequence using only continuous decision variables. The system is represented using a simplified centroidal dynamics model that is influenced by the feet's location and forces. We explicitly enforce friction cone constraints, depending on the shape of the terrain. The nonlinear programming problem solver generates highly dynamic motion plans with full flight phases for a variety of legged systems with arbitrary morphologies in an efficient manner. We validate the feasibility of the generated plans in simulation and on the real quadruped robot ANYmal. Additionally, the entire solver software TOWR, which used to generate these motions is made freely available.},

  abstract = {Magnetic torquing is attractive as means of control for small satellites. The actuation principle is to use the interaction between the earth's magnetic field and a magnetic field generated by a coil set in the satellite. This control principle is inherently time-varying, and difficult to use because control torques can only be generated perpendicular to the local geomagnetic field vector. This has been a serious obstacle for using magnetorquer based control for three-axis attitude control. This paper deals with three-axis stabilization of a low earth orbit satellite. The problem of controlling the spacecraft attitude using only magnetic torquing is realized in the form of a infinite horizon periodic controller},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a parallel-compiled tool that combines several of our recently developed methods for solving the perturbed Lambert problem using modified Chebyshev-Picard iteration. This tool (unified Lambert tool) consists of four individual algorithms, each of which is unique and better suited for solving a particular type of orbit transfer. The first is a Keplerian Lambert solver, which is used to provide a good initial guess (warm start) for solving the perturbed problem. It is also used to determine the appropriate algorithm to call for solving the perturbed problem. The arc length or true anomaly angle spanned by the transfer trajectory is the parameter that governs the automated selection of the appropriate perturbed algorithm, and is based on the respective algorithm convergence characteristics. The second algorithm solves the perturbed Lambert problem using the modified Chebyshev-Picard iteration two-point boundary value solver. This algorithm does not require a Newton-like shooting method and is the most efficient of the perturbed solvers presented herein, however the domain of convergence is limited to about a third of an orbit and is dependent on eccentricity. The third algorithm extends the domain of convergence of the modified Chebyshev-Picard iteration two-point boundary value solver to about 90\% of an orbit, through regularization with the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. This is the second most efficient of the perturbed set of algorithms. The fourth algorithm uses the method of particular solutions and the modified Chebyshev-Picard iteration initial value solver for solving multiple revolution perturbed transfers. This method does require ``shooting'' but differs from Newton-like shooting methods in that it does not require propagation of a state transition matrix. The unified Lambert tool makes use of the General Mission Analysis Tool and we use it to compute thousands of perturbed Lambert trajectories in parallel on the Space Situational Awareness computer cluster at the LASR Lab, Texas A\&M University. We demonstrate the power of our tool by solving a highly parallel example problem, that is the generation of extremal field maps for optimal spacecraft rendezvous (and eventual orbit debris removal). In addition we demonstrate the need for including perturbative effects in simulations for satellite tracking or data association. The unified Lambert tool is ideal for but not limited to space situational awareness applications.},

The constellation is in a Lissajous or Halo orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point (L2), in a passive formation flying mode. The Daughters' three dipole antennas detect low frequency radio waves and transmit the digitized data to the Mothership, where data correlation and digital signal processing are done to reduce the data volume for transmission back to the Earth. This paper presents a concept design of the satellite systems for such a space radio telescope array, using the recent micro- and Nanosatellite technologies and products. A preliminary concept design is presented for the 13 satellites involved in this mission, with brief discussion on the subsystems and technologies involved. Technical issues and potential solutions are discussed and further elaborated for the key technologies that enable such a complex science mission with links to the recent satellite engineering experiences.},

In this paper, we show that GRAPE can be taught to be more effective by jointly learning from the design model and the experimental data obtained from process tomography. The resulting data-driven gradient optimization algorithm (d-GRAPE) can in principle correct all deterministic gate errors, with a mild efficiency loss. The d-GRAPE algorithm may become more powerful with broadband controls that involve a large number of control parameters, while other algorithms usually slow down due to the increased size of the search space. These advantages are demonstrated by simulating the implementation of a two-qubit CNOT gate.},

This work is based on a recently proposed method that states the mechanical dynamics in a floating base description, makes the ground contact forces part of the free variable vector, and implements the requirement that a foot is either on the ground or that the corresponding contact force is zero via a set of complimentary conditions. We introduce an algorithmic improvement that uses higher order integration for states that are continuous through collisions and thus increases the accuracy of the obtained solutions. The benefits of the proposed changes are evaluated with the models of a 1D hopper and a 2D bipedal robot, and we additionally compare our results with analytic solutions and an established multiple shooting implementation. The proposed method was able to automatically discover walking and running as the most energetically economic ways of locomotion for a conceptual biped that is moving at different speed. It additionally discovers an elastic walking gait that is used at intermediate velocities.},

With the explosive growth of NanoSats/CubeSats, Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) of NanoSats/CubeSats has undergone a profound transform and has changed from the initial passive attitude stabilization to active and precise attitude control. This paper summarizes the current state of the art in NanoSats/CubeSats technology for ADCS, based on an available data base of 377 sample ADCS systems from publically reported Nano/CubeSats missions. The advancement of NanoSat/CubeSat missions and their ADCS requirements are first summarized, a discussion on various ADCS sensors, attitude determination algorithms, actuators, and control schemes is then conducted. Further analyses on the various ADCS schemes versus their achievable performances are provided. This survey shows, NanoSat-compatible attitude actuators, miniaturized attitude sensors, GPS receivers and various attitude determination algorithms were widely adopted to achieve different pointing requirements. The reported attitude pointing accuracy has seen a range from being above 10 deg down to below 1 deg (according to different control schemes). Statistics indicates that almost every successfully launched NanoSat/CubeSat employs magnetometer, Sun sensors and magnetic coils; about 23\% of the NanoSats/CubeSats had adopted passive attitude control strategies while more than 50\% of them had adopted the advanced reaction wheels-based attitude control strategies, which would provide precise pointing.},

However, it does not handle either state or control constraints. This paper presents a novel formulation of DDP that is able to accommodate arbitrary nonlinear inequality constraints on both state and control. The main insight in standard DDP is that a quadratic approximation of the value function can be derived using a recursive backward pass, however the recursive formulae are only valid for unconstrained problems. The main technical contribution of the presented method is a derivation of the recursive quadratic approximation formula in the presence of nonlinear constraints, after a set of active constraints has been identified at each point in time. This formula is used in a new Constrained-DDP (CDDP) algorithm that iteratively determines these active set and is guaranteed to converge toward a local minimum. CDDP is demonstrated on several underactuated optimal control problems up to 12D with obstacle avoidance and control constraints and is shown to outperform other methods for accommodating constraints.},

In recent years, scientists have been pursuing methods to improve the performance of accelerometers, particularly through seeking new sensing mechanisms. Herein, we present a synchronized oscillator-based enhancement approach to realize a fivefold resolution improvement of a microelectromechanical resonant accelerometer. Through the unidirectional electrical coupling method, we achieved synchronization of the sensing oscillator of the microelectromechanical resonant accelerometer and an external reading oscillator, which remarkably enhanced the stability of the oscillation system to 19.4\,ppb and the resolution of the accelerometer to 1.91\,{$\mu$}g. In addition, the narrow synchronization bandwidth of conventional synchronized oscillators was discussed, and hence, we propose a novel frequency automatic tracking system to expand the synchronization bandwidth from 113 to 1246\,Hz, which covers the full acceleration measurement range of {\textpm}1\,g. For the first time, we utilized a unidirectional electrical synchronization mechanism to improve the resolution of resonant sensors. Our comprehensive scheme provides a general and powerful solution for performance enhancement of any microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonant sensor, thereby enabling a wide spectrum of applications.}

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning can generate complex control policies, but requires large amounts of training data to work effectively. Recent work has attempted to address this issue by leveraging differentiable simulators. However, inherent problems such as local minima and exploding/vanishing numerical gradients prevent these methods from being generally applied to control tasks with complex contact-rich dynamics, such as humanoid locomotion in classical RL benchmarks. In this work we present a high-performance differentiable simulator and a new policy learning algorithm (SHAC) that can effectively leverage simulation gradients, even in the presence of non-smoothness. Our learning algorithm alleviates problems with local minima through a smooth critic function, avoids vanishing/exploding gradients through a truncated learning window, and allows many physical environments to be run in parallel. We evaluate our method on classical RL control tasks, and show substantial improvements in sample efficiency and wall-clock time over state-of-the-art RL and differentiable simulation-based algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by applying it to the challenging high-dimensional problem of muscle-actuated locomotion with a large action space, achieving a greater than 17{\texttimes} reduction in training time over the best-performing established RL algorithm.

  author = {Xu, Zheng and Figueiredo, M{\'a}rio A T and Goldstein, Tom},
  abstract = {The alternating direction method of multi-pliers (ADMM) is a versatile tool for solving a wide range of constrained optimization problems. However, its performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, making ADMM often unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method that adaptively tunes the penalty parameter to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.}

Here, we assess three representative learning algorithms, including GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE), improved Nelder-Mead (NMplus) and Differential Evolution (DE), by searching for high-quality control pulses to prepare the Bell state. We first implement each algorithm experimentally in a nuclear magnetic resonance system and then conduct a numerical study considering the impact of some possible significant experimental uncertainties. The experiments report the successful preparation of the high-fidelity target state with different convergence speeds by the three algorithms, and these results coincide with the numerical simulations when potential uncertainties are negligible. However, under certain significant uncertainties, these algorithms possess distinct performance with respect to their resulting precision and efficiency. This study provides insight to aid in the practical application of different closed-loop learning algorithms in realistic physical scenarios.},

A neural projection operator lies at the heart of our approach, composed of a lightweight network with an embedded recursive architecture that interactively enforces learned underpinning constraints and predicts the various governed behaviors of different physical systems. Our neural projection operator is motivated by the position-based dynamics model that has been used widely in game and visual effects industries to unify the various fast physics simulators. Our method can automatically and effectively uncover a broad range of constraints from observation point data, such as length, angle, bending, collision, boundary effects, and their arbitrary combinations, without any connectivity priors. We provide a multi-group point representation in conjunction with a configurable network connection mechanism to incorporate prior inputs for processing complex physical systems. We demonstrated the efficacy of our approach by learning a set of challenging physical systems all in a unified and simple fashion including: rigid bodies with complex geometries, ropes with varying length and bending, articulated soft and rigid bodies, and multi-object collisions with complex boundaries.},

  abstract = {Effective water resources management in California relies substantially on real-time information of snow water equivalent (SWE) at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the State. However, SWE estimation based solely on remote sensing, modeling, or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements. In this context, this study develops a data-fusion framework that combines multi-source datasets including satellite-observed daily mean fractional snowcovered area (DMFSCA), snow pillow SWE measurements, physiographic data, and historical SWE patterns into a linear regression model (LRM) to improve SWE estimates in real-time. We test two LRMs: a baseline regression model (LRM-baseline) that uses physiographic data and historical SWE patterns as independent variables, and an FSCA-informed regression model (LRM-FSCA) that includes the DMFSCA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery as an additional independent variable. By incorporating the satellite-observed DMFSCA, LRM-FSCA outperforms LRM-baseline with increased median R2 from 0.54 to 0.60, and reduced median PBIAS of basin average SWE from 2.6\% to 2.2\% in the snow pillow SWE cross-validation. LRM-FSCA explains 87\% of the variance in the snow course SWE measurements with 0.1\% PBIAS, while LRM-baseline explains a lower 81\% variance with 1.4\% PBIAS, both of which show higher accuracy than SWE estimates from the two operational SWE datasets: the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS, 73\% and -2.4\%, respectively) and Nationtional Water Model (NWM, 75\% and -15.9\%, respectively). Additionally, LRM-FSCA explains 85\% of the median variance in the Airborne Snow Observatory SWE with -9.2\% PBIAS, which is comparable to the LRM-baseline (86\% and -11.3\%, respectively) and considerably better than SNODAS (64\% and 28.2\%, respectively) and NWM (33\% and -30.1\%, respectively). This study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow-cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi-source observations in real-time SWE estimation. The developed SWE estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in Cali\- fornia, where climate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods) require particularly skillful monitoring practices.},

An extended Kalman filter is used to fuse data from all sensors to estimate the robot's body and foot positions in the world frame. Using the additional IMUs, the filter is able to reliably determine foot contact modes and detect foot slips without tactile or pressure-based foot contact sensors. This sensing solution is validated in various hardware experiments, which confirm that it can reduce position drift by nearly an order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches with only a very modest increase in hardware and computational costs.},

Measuring shear forces is useful for grasping and manipulating objects; however, there are limited effective shear sensing strategies that are compatible with existing end effectors. Here, we report a bioinspired and flexible, resistive microfluidic shear force sensor skin. The sensor skin is wrapped around a finger-shaped end effector and fixed at the location of the nail bed. When the skin is subjected to shear force, one side of the skin experiences tension while the other side experiences compression and bulges similar to a human fingerpad. The tension and compression are measured by liquid metal strain gauges, embedded in PDMS, that are strategically placed adjacent to the nail bed, away from regions of direct finger-object contact. We present the sensor design, a finite element analysis static mechanical characterization model, as well as static response experiments. The resistive shear sensing skin exhibits greater than 10-bit dynamic range (up to 5 N) that is insensitive to the applied normal force. The resistive shear sensing skin is intrinsically flexible and immune to fatigue and other problems of solid-state sensors when subjected to repeated, large strains.},

A scissored-pair configuration is applied to the single-gimbal control moment gyros, which guarantees control torque exclusively along the roll axis and avoids internal singularity. A sliding-mode attitude controller is proposed to meet the requirements of rollchannel attitude stability and disturbance rejection. To obtain an optimal allocation of the commanded torque to the single-gimbal control moment gyros and the reaction control system, an allocation method based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. To render the design and validation of the control scheme close to reality, the responsiveness of the singlegimbal control moment gyro is considered, and the discrete and delay properties of the reaction control system are included. The steering logic of the single-gimbal control moment gyro and the modulator of the reaction control system are designed, respectively. Numerical simulation is performed to verify the proposed control scheme. Moreover, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system based on an air-bearing test bed is developed to conduct experiments for convincingly validating the proposed attitude control method. The feasibility and good performance of the proposed control scheme are verified by the results of the numerical simulation and the experiment.},

However, training such a robot would require extensive trials in order to learn the skills of assistive dressing. Such training would be time-consuming and require considerable effort to recruit participants and conduct trials. In addition, for some cases that might cause injury to the person being dressed, it is impractical and unethical to perform such trials. In this work, we focus on a representative dressing task of pulling the sleeve of a hospital gown onto a person's arm. We present a system that learns a haptic classifier for the outcome of the task given few (2-3) real-world trials with one person. Our system first optimizes the parameters of a physics simulator using real-world data. Using the optimized simulator, the system then simulates more haptic sensory data with noise models that account for randomness in the experiment. We then train hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on the simulated haptic data. The trained HMMs can then be used to classify and predict the outcome of the assistive dressing task based on haptic signals measured by a real robot's end effector. This system achieves 92.83\% accuracy in classifying the outcome of the robot-assisted dressing task with people not included in simulation optimization. We compare our classifiers to those trained on real-world data.

  abstract = {Vision is one of the essential perception modalities for legged robots to safely and efficiently navigate uneven terrains, such as stairs and stepping stones. However, training robots to effectively understand high-dimensional visual input for locomotion is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a framework to train a vision-based locomotion controller which enables a quadrupedal robot to traverse uneven environments. The key idea is to introduce a hierarchical structure with a high-level vision policy and a low-level motion controller. The high-level vision policy takes as inputs the perceived vision signals as well as robot states and outputs the desired footholds and base movement of the robot. These are then realized by the low level motion controller composed of a position controller for swing legs and a MPC-based torque controller for stance legs. We train the vision policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning and demonstrate our approach on a variety of uneven environments such as randomly placed stepping stones, quincuncial piles, stairs, and moving platforms. We also validate our method on a real robot to walk over a series of gaps and climbing up a platform.}

  abstract = {Real-time implementation of optimisation-based control and trajectory planning can be very challenging for nonlinear systems. As a result, if an implementation based on a fixed linearisation is not suitable, the nonlinear problems are typically locally approximated online, in order to leverage the speed and robustness of embedded solvers for convex quadratic programs (QP) developed during the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, using simple standard building blocks from nonlinear programming, combined with a structure-exploiting linear system solver, it is possible to achieve computation times in the range typical of solvers for QPs, while retaining nonlinearities and solving the nonlinear programs (NLP) to local optimality. The implemented algorithm is an interior-point method with approximate Hessians and adaptive barrier rules, and is provided as an extension to the C code generator FORCES. Three detailed examples are provided that illustrate a significant improvement in control performance when solving NLPs, with computation times that are comparable with those achieved by fast approximate schemes and up to an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art interior-point solver IPOPT.},

This paper describes an approach that uses simulation to detect possible such behavioral divergences on real robots. This approach, and others like it, could be applied to validation of robot behaviors, mechanism design, and even online planning. The particle trace approach samples robot modeling parameters, sensory readings, and state estimates to evaluate a robot's behavior statistically over a range of conditions. We demonstrate that combining even coarse estimates of state and modeling parameters with fast multibody simulation can be sufficient to detect divergent robot behavior and characterize robot performance in the real world. Correspondingly, this approach could be used to assess risk and find and analyze likely failures, given the extensive data that such simulations can generate.},

  abstract = {Considering visual localization accuracy at the planning time gives preference to robot motion that can be better localized and thus has the potential of improving vision-based navigation, especially in visually degraded environments. To integrate the knowledge about localization accuracy in motion planning algorithms, a central task is to quantify the amount of information that an image taken at a 6 degree-of-freedom pose brings for localization, which is often represented by the Fisher information. However, computing the Fisher information from a set of sparse landmarks (i.e., a point cloud), which is the most common map for visual localization, is inefficient. This approach scales linearly with the number of landmarks in the environment and does not allow the reuse of the computed Fisher information. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the first dedicated map representation for evaluating the Fisher information of 6 degree-of-freedom visual localization for perception-aware motion planning. By formulating the Fisher information and sensor visibility carefully, we are able to separate the rotational invariant component from the Fisher information and store it in a voxel grid, namely the Fisher information field. This step only needs to be performed once for a known environment. The Fisher information for arbitrary poses can then be computed from the field in constant time, eliminating the need of costly iterating all the 3D landmarks at the planning time. Experimental results show that the proposed Fisher information field can be applied to different motion planning algorithms and is at least one order-of-magnitude faster than using the point cloud directly. Moreover,the proposed map representation is differentiable, resulting in better performance than the point cloud when used in trajectory optimization algorithms.},

Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed towards closing this sim-toreal gap and accomplish more efficient policy transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application scenarios. Finally, we discuss the main opportunities and challenges of the different approaches and point to the most promising directions.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle let robots automatically adapt to new tasks, but current RL methods require a large number of trials to accomplish this. In this paper, we tackle rapid adaptation to new tasks through the framework of meta-learning, which utilizes past tasks to learn to adapt with a specific focus on industrial insertion tasks. Fast adaptation is crucial because prohibitively large number of on-robot trials will potentially damage hardware pieces. Additionally, effective adaptation is also feasible in that experience among different insertion applications can be largely leveraged by each other. In this setting, we address two specific challenges when applying meta-learning. First, conventional meta-RL algorithms require lengthy online meta-training. We show that this can be replaced with appropriately chosen offline data, resulting in an offline meta-RL method that only requires demonstrations and trials from each of the prior tasks, without the need to run costly meta-RL procedures online. Second, meta-RL methods can fail to generalize to new tasks that are too different from those seen at meta-training time, which poses a particular challenge in industrial applications, where high success rates are critical. We address this by combining contextual meta-learning with direct online finetuning: if the new task is similar to those seen in the prior data, then the contextual meta-learner adapts immediately, and if it is too different, it gradually adapts through finetuning. We show that our approach is able to quickly adapt to a variety of different insertion tasks, with a success rate of 100\% using only a fraction of the samples needed for learning the tasks from scratch.

In real-world scenarios where environments can be complex and non-homogeneous, a robot needs to be able to gauge whether a state will be in collision with various objects in order to meet some safety metrics. The collision detector should be computationally efficient and, ideally, analytically differentiable to facilitate stable and rapid gradient descent during optimization.

  abstract = {The objective of trajectory optimization algorithms is to achieve an optimal collision-free path between a start and goal state. In real-world scenarios where environments can be complex and non-homogeneous, a robot needs to be able to gauge whether a state will be in collision with various objects in order to meet some safety metrics. The collision detector should be computationally efficient and, ideally, analytically differentiable to facilitate stable and rapid gradient descent during optimization. However, methods today lack an elegant approach to detect collision differentiably, relying rather on numerical gradients that can be unstable. We present DiffCo, the first, fully auto-differentiable, non-parametric model for collision detection.

  abstract = {A central aspect of robotic motion planning is collision avoidance, where a multitude of different approaches are currently in use. Optimization-based motion planning is one method, that often heavily relies on distance computations between robots and obstacles. These computations can easily become a bottleneck, as they do not scale well with the complexity of the robots or the environment. To improve performance, many different methods suggested to use collision primitives, i.e. simple shapes that approximate the more complex rigid bodies, and that are simpler to compute distances to and from. However, each pair of primitives requires its own specialized code, and certain pairs are known to suffer from numerical issues. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use, unified treatment of a wide variety of primitives. We formulate distance computation as a minimization problem, which we solve iteratively. We show how to take derivatives of this minimization problem, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into a trajectory optimization method. Our experiments show that our method performs favourably, both in terms of timing and the quality of the trajectory. The source code of our implementation will be released upon acceptance.},

CHOMP uses functional gradient techniques to iteratively improve the quality of an initial trajectory, optimizing a functional that trades off between a smoothness and an obstacle avoidance component. CHOMP can be used to locally optimize feasible trajectories, as well as to solve motion planning queries, converging to lowcost trajectories even when initialized with infeasible ones. It uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to alleviate the problem of convergence to high-cost local minima (and for probabilistic completeness), and is capable of respecting hard constraints along the trajectory. We present extensive experiments with CHOMP on manipulation and locomotion tasks, using 7-DOF manipulators and a rough-terrain quadruped robot.},
